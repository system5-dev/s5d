## E.9 - Design‑Rationale Record (DRR) Method

> **Type:** Governance / authoring pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### E.9:0 - Use this when

- one proposed normative change needs an explicit by-value account of what FPF should say, why this decision is preferred, and which neighboring patterns or governing support surfaces it affects
- several patterns or governing support surfaces must move together and one external decision artefact is needed to keep one bounded coordinated change set (one mutually dependent change set) semantically complete while enduring Core text is redistributed
- one bounded content burden would otherwise force authors to decide the same load-bearing answer separately across several patterns or governing support surfaces
- one deprecation, narrowing, or cross-pattern amendment must stay reviewable without reconstructing intent from patch history, chat memory, or scattered notes

**Not this pattern when.** Do not use `E.9` as the permanent location of normative Core law, as a campaign/workflow brief, or as the main vehicle for purely editorial `Δ‑0/Δ‑1` cleanup that fits the lightweight variant in `CC‑DRR.5`.

### E.9:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

- Core text changes without one explicit rationale account, so later readers cannot recover which alternatives were rejected or which exclusions were intentional
- coordinated multi-pattern amendments drift apart because the temporary selected-answer account survives only in patches, handoffs, or reviewer memory
- future repairs overfit to local wording and silently lose Pillar, taxonomy-lens, impact-graph, practical-use, or pattern-placement discipline

### E.9:0.2 - What this buys

- one external decision artefact that states the bounded FPF change by value before Core text is rewritten
- one minimum kernel that keeps Problem frame, Decision, Rationale, and Consequences recoverable for later review and replay
- one temporary convergence artefact for coordinated changes, while keeping enduring Core text in the selected patterns and governing support surfaces rather than in the DRR
- one temporary convergence artefact that fixes the selected answer (the chosen content answer for the bounded burden) before later drafting fans out across several selected patterns or governing support surfaces

**Governed object in plain terms.** The governed object here is one external decision-rationale artefact for one bounded FPF content decision or one bounded coordinated change set. The minimal lens is simple: the artefact must keep the problem frame, decision, rationale, consequences, and impact/boundary account recoverable enough that accepted content can be distributed into the selected Core patterns and governing support surfaces without semantic invention.

**Primary working reader.** The first working reader is an FPF author, reviewer, or steward who must evaluate, challenge, or land one bounded content decision. Downstream pattern readers benefit from the landed Core text; they are not the primary reader of the DRR itself.

### E.9:1 - Problem frame
FPF is engineered for Pillar **P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution**: its normative
rules must adapt as new calculi and insights arrive. But change without a
record of *why* leads to conceptual erosion and undermines auditability.
Hence FPF requires an explicit **Design‑Rationale Record (DRR)**—a
durable *conceptual artefact* that precedes every normative change.

### E.9:2 - Problem
Direct edits to the Core, absent a structured rationale, trigger three
systemic hazards:

1. **Lost provenance** – future authors cannot infer the reasoning behind
   a rule; intent decays.
2. **Implicit assumptions** – discarded alternatives vanish from memory,
   so debates resurface and churn repeats.
3. **Conceptual drift** – incremental tweaks slip past the Eleven Pillars
   and Principle Taxonomy lenses, blurring the framework’s foundations.

### E.9:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Agility vs Rigour** | Evolve swiftly ↔ demonstrate deliberate, Pillar‑aligned decisions. |
| **Transparency vs Efficiency** | Provide a public argument trail ↔ avoid bureaucratic drag on minor edits. |
| **Clarity vs Conciseness** | Capture enough reasoning and coordinated implications ↔ prevent meta‑text from bloating the Core itself. |

### E.9:4 - Solution — the DRR as a structured argument and temporary convergence artefact
Any proposal to add, modify or deprecate a `NORM`, `A`, `D`, or `GOV`
rule **MUST** be accompanied by a **Design‑Rationale Record**. By default,
a conforming DRR contains at least four conceptual components (below);
these form the minimum decision kernel recoverable by any conforming DRR.
A lightweight editorial variant is permitted by CC‑DRR.5.

In this pattern, a **bounded coordinated change set** means one bounded
group of mutually dependent content decisions whose enduring FPF
expression will be distributed across several patterns or governing support surfaces.
In this pattern, the **selected answer** means the current set of chosen
content decisions for that bounded burden: what FPF should say, which
selected patterns or governing support surfaces carry it, what stays outside, and what support or
loss/recoverability regime applies.
In this pattern, a **temporary convergence artefact** means one external
decision artefact that temporarily holds the selected answer while
the selected Core patterns and governing support surfaces are still being updated.

A nontrivial DRR may therefore govern one bounded coordinated change set.
In that case the DRR is the temporary convergence artefact for the selected
answer until selected Core patterns and governing support surfaces are updated; it is not a second
permanent law layer.

| Minimum-kernel component | Guiding question | Typical content |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Problem frame** | *Why are we talking about this?* | Problem statement, triggering insight, intended FPF use-value, scenario basis, or external change. |
| **Decision** | *What will we do?* | Precise normative text, selected content distribution, explicit outside-current-decision disposition, or other substantive change law to enter the specification. |
| **Rationale** | *Why is this the right thing?* | Comparison of alternatives, Pillar check, taxonomy-lens balance, architecture/usability/SoTA grounds. |
| **Consequences** | *What follows from this choice?* | Expected benefits, trade-offs, impacted patterns and governing support surfaces, practical gains/costs, and remaining validation burden. |

#### E.9:4.1 - Minimum decision-support surfaces

A conforming DRR must also make the following decision-support surfaces
recoverable. They may live inside the four kernel components or inside one
dedicated `Basis used` / decision-support block, but they are part of
substantive DRR adequacy rather than later review-only hardening.

| Decision-support surface | What must be recoverable by value | Usual location in the DRR |
|---|---|---|
| **Exact substantive basis and governing inheritance** | Exact basis sources and inherited architecture/audit basis that materially govern the decision, plus any still-live uncertainty not already closed by that basis. | Header or `Basis used`, with Problem frame/Rationale support. |
| **Purpose, utility, and scenario basis** | Intended FPF use-value, first-minute working situation, minimum scenario/anti-case basis, and compact utility/fitness reading. | Problem frame. |
| **Alternatives and current disposition map** | Material alternatives plus one current disposition for each still-live burden this DRR must settle: `selected now`, `rejected now`, `inherited unchanged`, or `outside current decision with named pattern/support surface/decision record`. When the accepted basis or the DRR itself already names one pattern or governing support surface as part of the live distribution question, that named pattern or support surface is already part of the current disposition map and must not remain one conditional watch item. | Decision and Rationale. |

| **Surface-distribution and outside-boundary map** | For each load-bearing selected answer: selected patterns and governing support surfaces, exact content obligations on each selected pattern or support surface, which nearby patterns or support surfaces stay unamended under the current decision, and any cross-surface agreement that those selected patterns and support surfaces must preserve. Named nearby patterns or support surfaces must be classified now, not left as tentative `most likely` / `may need` / `if later touched` watch prose. | Decision. |

| **Existing-pattern sufficiency and new-pattern necessity** | For each load-bearing selected answer, whether one already-existing pattern is sufficient, one already-existing governing support surface is sufficient, or one newly selected pattern or governing support surface is necessary, and why rejected options would misplace, overload, or falsely split semantic authority. | Decision and Rationale. |
| **Naming, ontology, and wrong-carrier-confusion account** | Head/branch/object/move/outside-work separation, tempting wrong-pattern or wrong-support-surface confusion, and any load-bearing `F.18` naming burden needed to keep the selected answer truthful by value. | Problem frame, Decision, and Rationale. |
| **Reusable-support disposition when triggered** | Whether a potentially reusable support object/view/helper family remains local, is generalized now, is rejected, or is routed outside the current decision with named pattern/support surface/decision record. | Decision and Rationale. |
| **Loss and recoverability template when weakening is declared** | Preserved distinctions, dropped distinctions, supported use, unsupported downstream use, recoverability class, and reopen/exit rule. | Decision and Consequences. |
| **Selected carrier and neighbor-boundary account** | Why the selected patterns and governing support surfaces carry the content, which tempting patterns or support surfaces stay outside, and which neighboring reroutes remain authoritative. | Decision and Rationale. |
| **Convergence and overlap account when several burden branches touch the same carrier set** | Whether overlap is valid convergence or one reopened architecture smell, what cross-surface agreements must hold, and whether a new pattern or support surface is actually selected or refused now. | Decision and Consequences. |
| **Selected-answer stability boundary** | Which elements of the selected answer are fixed now for later FPF drafting, and which later elaborations may strengthen wording, examples, or support without reopening the selected answer. | Decision and Consequences. |
| **Impact, practical gains, and remaining validation burden** | Affected patterns and governing support surfaces, practical gains/costs, authority or release consequences when they follow from the content decision, and the remaining validation burden that still constrains later authoring or landing. | Consequences. |
| **SoTA and competitive-positioning account when load-bearing** | Current anchors that discipline the decision, what problem-owning domain or practice they answer to, and what unresolved uncertainty would materially change the selected answer. | Problem frame, Rationale, and Consequences. |

These support surfaces are not separate process paperwork. A DRR that keeps
only the four labels while leaving basis, first-minute use burden, naming,
selected content distribution, pattern/support-surface sufficiency or necessity, overlap handling, impact,
or live uncertainty implicit is structurally labeled but still
substantively immature.

Together these support surfaces let the DRR act as one decision artefact
for one bounded coordinated change set: enough semantic closure that later
drafting distributes the selected answer into selected patterns and governing support surfaces rather than
inventing it for the first time pattern by pattern.

When one bounded decision coordinates several patterns or governing support
surfaces, or one cluster of mutually dependent pattern edits and
support-surface edits, the DRR **MAY**
carry additional substantive sections beyond that minimum kernel. Typical
Typical substantive additions include obligations on selected patterns and support surfaces, one explicit
new-pattern vs existing-pattern decision, one cross-pattern/support-surface impact or non-goal
map, cross-surface coverage or agreement maps, convergence
classification, and one provisional decision-law account by value that
keeps the bounded change account semantically complete until enduring
Core text is distributed.

Such additions do not change the DRR’s kind. A DRR carrying them remains
conforming only when it stays about the FPF content decision: what FPF should
say, why, what is excluded, how selected patterns and governing support surfaces are
affected, and what practical burden improves. A DRR carrying richer
convergence content **MUST NOT** become a campaign plan, workflow script,
baton carrier, packet checklist, staging log, or other development-process
brief.

When one selected answer could plausibly fit one already-existing pattern or support surface
or require one newly proposed pattern or support surface, the DRR must decide that
sufficiency/necessity question by value. It is not enough to list a
tentative carrier list or leave downstream drafting to discover the selected pattern or support surface later.

When the accepted basis or the DRR itself already names one pattern or
governing support surface as part of the live distribution question, that
pattern or support surface is not a neutral future watch item. The DRR
must classify it now either as one selected pattern or support surface
with explicit obligation, one explicit boundary neighbor kept unchanged,
one inherited-unchanged neighbor, or one outside-current-decision burden
with named pattern/support surface/decision record. Conditional or
time-relative host prose such as `most likely`, `may need local
hardening`, `if later touched`, `watch later`, or one equivalent
placeholder is non-conforming there because it marks one unmade current
decision rather than one explicit current disposition.


When one accepted basis exposes one potentially reusable local support
object, view, atlas/helper family, or neighboring support mechanism, the
DRR must not merely note that such support already exists. It must decide
whether that support is generalized now, kept local with a substantive
reason, rejected, or marked outside the current decision with a named pattern, support surface, or decision record.

When one burden involves weakening, attenuation, simplification, redaction,
summarization, or other declared loss, the DRR must make the supported-use template explicit by value. Explanation alone is not enough; the decision
must say what remains preserved, what is dropped, which branch reading or
support surface is supported, which uses are unsupported, what recoverability class
applies, and what reopen or exit rule governs cases that exceed the
declared weakening.

A nontrivial DRR is mature enough for downstream authoring only when
materially live burden-family choices about the governed object, selected patterns and support surfaces, outside-current-decision boundary, reusable-support disposition,
and loss/recoverability regime have already been selected, rejected,
inherited unchanged, or routed outside the current decision with a named pattern, support surface, or decision record. If those choices are still missing, the DRR is still basis work
rather than one accepted design-rationale record.

The DRR lives **outside** the normative Core. An accepted DRR **SHALL** be
landed by applying its Decision account and any stabilized enduring
content to the relevant pattern(s) or other Core support surfaces as explicit
normative or informative text (the change is "in the Core"; the DRR is
not). A richer DRR **MAY** remain the temporary convergence artefact while
redistribution into selected Core patterns and governing support surfaces is still incomplete, but it
**SHALL NOT** remain the permanent sole semantic carrier once landed Core text
exists.

Authors drafting from an accepted DRR **MAY** elaborate examples,
SoTA‑Echoing, recognition surfaces, local wording inside the selected patterns and support surfaces, and neighboring fit. They **SHALL NOT** silently revise the selected answer, selected patterns and support surfaces, outside-current-decision boundary, reusable-support disposition, or
declared loss/recoverability regime. Any such revision **SHALL** be routed
through one successor DRR or other named successor decision record.

To preserve **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** without duplicating meta‑text,
authors landing an accepted DRR **SHOULD** distill stable and reusable
parts of its *Rationale*, *Consequences*, and other valid convergence
sections into the appropriate **informative** sections of the affected
pattern(s) (Rationale, Consequences, SoTA‑Echoing, Archetypal Grounding;
per the Pattern Template, E.8). The full DRR remains external as
provenance.

A substantive DRR is one current content decision object. It may carry
selected content obligations only when they are part of the
Decision or Consequences. It **MUST NOT** carry next-gate posture,
handoff/packet state, route order, monolith status, future campaign
planning, or one hidden promise that the same current burden will be
decided later inside the same decision object. Any undecided remainder must
be marked outside the current decision with a named pattern, support surface, or decision record.

### E.9:5 - Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Holon flavour | DRR analogue | Minimum kernel illustrated |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **`U.System`** (physical) | Engineering Change Order for pump motor upgrade. | Context: inefficiency and plant-use burden; Decision: switch to brushless DC and update the selected control/maintenance patterns or support surfaces; Rationale: energy gain vs cost and authority fit; Consequences: new control schema, supplier change, validation burden. |
| **`U.Episteme`** (knowledge) | Foundational theory revision paper. | Context: conflicting data and explanatory burden; Decision: introduce new axiom and distribute its consequences into the selected theory/teaching patterns or support surfaces; Rationale: explains legacy & new data, Pillar alignment, alternative rejection; Consequences: fresh predictions, update to curricula, downstream review burden. |

### E.9:6 - Bias-Annotation

| Lens | Bias risk in DRR use | Mitigation in this pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Gov** | The DRR can become a bureaucratic approval ritual rather than a decision-rationale artefact. | Keep `CC-DRR.5` for lightweight editorial changes and require richer DRRs only when the content decision is semantically load-bearing. |
| **Arch** | A rich DRR can become a shadow specification that competes with the selected Core patterns and governing support surfaces. | Treat the DRR as temporary convergence support; enduring content is distributed into the selected Core patterns and support surfaces. |
| **Onto/Epist** | Authors can mix content decisions, evidence basis, process state, and provenance into one ambiguous object. | Require exact substantive basis and selected-answer boundaries while excluding route, baton, packet, and mutable status posture from the DRR. |
| **Prag** | The method adds work before editing Core text. | Allow pointer-based DRRs and require only the support surfaces materially needed for the selected decision. |
| **Did** | Rationale can become too internal for later authors to use. | Distill stable rationale, consequences, anti-cases, and SoTA implications into informative pattern sections when the Core text is updated. |

Scope: this bias annotation is universal for FPF semantic changes governed by `E.9`. It does not turn project-management state, helper state, or review logistics into DRR content.
### E.9:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑DRR.1** | Any Δ‑2/Δ‑3 semantic change set against a `NORM`, `A`, `D`, or `GOV` pattern **SHALL** be backed by an accepted DRR containing at least Problem‑frame (Context), Decision, Rationale, and Consequences. | Prevents undocumented semantic edits while setting a minimum kernel rather than an artificial ceiling. |
| **CC‑DRR.1a** | A DRR whose proposed change is expressed as a new or revised pattern written in the standard template (E.8) **MAY** satisfy that minimum kernel by **pointing to** the corresponding pattern sections rather than duplicating prose. | Avoids “double writing” while keeping the argument recoverable. |
| **CC‑DRR.1b (rich convergence content is permitted)** | A DRR that coordinates several patterns or governing support surfaces, or mutually dependent pattern and support-surface changes, **MAY** include additional substantive sections beyond the minimum kernel—for example obligations on selected patterns or support surfaces, explicit new-pattern vs existing-pattern decisions, boundary/non-goal maps, cross-surface coverage or agreement maps, convergence classification, or one provisional decision-law account by value—provided that the DRR stays about the FPF content decision and **MUST NOT** become process/workflow management. | Allows one semantically sufficient convergence artefact for coordinated changes without forcing mid-distribution invention or extra shadow documents. |
| **CC‑DRR.1c (exact basis is recoverable)** | A conforming DRR **MUST** make its exact substantive basis and governing inheritance recoverable by value, either in one dedicated `Basis used` section or one equivalent header/support block. Routing, status, and provenance records do not count unless their substantive content still governs the decision by value. | Prevents anti-telephone drift and keeps the decision inspectable against its real basis. |
| **CC‑DRR.1d (problem-frame adequacy)** | The Problem frame **MUST** make the intended FPF use-value, first-minute working situation, minimum scenario/anti-case basis, compact utility/fitness reading, and any load-bearing current SoTA / competitive-positioning basis or exact inherited-basis justification recoverable by value. | Prevents a DRR from being formally labeled but pragmatically under-specified. |
| **CC‑DRR.1e (current disposition map and surface obligations)** | The Decision **MUST** name the selected patterns and governing support surfaces and the content obligations each selected pattern or support surface must carry by value. For every load-bearing selected answer and for every still-live burden explicitly routed to this DRR by accepted basis, the Decision **MUST** record one current disposition now: `selected now`, `rejected now`, `inherited unchanged`, or `outside current decision with named pattern/support surface/decision record`. When one pattern or governing support surface is already named as part of that live distribution question, the Decision **MUST NOT** leave it in conditional or time-relative host prose such as `most likely`, `may need`, or `if later touched`. | Stops hidden deferral, including conditional/time-relative carrier-list wording, and prevents tentative carrier-list prose from replacing real content decisions. |

| **CC‑DRR.1f (reusable-support disposition when triggered)** | When accepted basis exposes a potentially reusable support object, view, helper family, or neighboring support mechanism, the DRR **MUST** decide whether it is generalized now, kept local with reason, rejected, or routed outside the current decision with named pattern/support surface/decision record. | Prevents unexamined inheritance of local support forms. |
| **CC‑DRR.1g (loss/recoverability template when triggered)** | If the decision declares weakening, attenuation, simplification, redaction, summarization, or other loss, the DRR **MUST** make explicit the preserved distinctions, dropped distinctions, supported uses, unsupported downstream uses, recoverability class, and reopen/exit rule. | Prevents rhetorical smoothing from masquerading as stable content. |
| **CC‑DRR.1h (naming and ontology adequacy)** | A conforming DRR **MUST** make the selected head/branch/object/move/outside-work separation recoverable by value and **MUST** expose any tempting wrong-pattern or wrong-support-surface confusion or load-bearing `F.18` naming burden that materially affects the decision. | Prevents semantically important naming and typing choices from being rediscovered later during pattern drafting. |
| **CC‑DRR.1i (existing-pattern sufficiency or new-pattern necessity is explicit)** | When a load-bearing selected answer could plausibly live in one already-existing pattern, one already-existing governing support surface, or one newly proposed pattern or governing support surface, the DRR **MUST** make that sufficiency/necessity judgement by value and **MUST** explain why rejected options would misplace, overload, or falsely split semantic authority. | Prevents carrier selection from being rediscovered during downstream drafting. |
| **CC‑DRR.1j (selected-answer stability boundary is explicit)** | The Decision or Consequences **MUST** make clear which elements of the selected answer are fixed now for later FPF drafting and which later elaborations may strengthen wording, examples, or support without reopening the selected answer. | Prevents later drafting from silently widening or re-deciding the accepted answer. |
| **CC‑DRR.2** | A conforming DRR **MUST** include a rationale account that compares the materially live alternatives and assesses the selected proposal against **all Eleven Pillars** and the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`). | Keeps evolution aligned, comparative, and cross‑disciplinary. |
| **CC‑DRR.3** | The DRR **SHALL** list every pattern, governing support surface, or neighboring pattern/support surface it supersedes, amends, excludes from the current decision, routes to, or risks impacting, together with any cross-surface agreement the selected patterns and support surfaces must preserve. It **MUST** also make clear why the selected patterns and support surfaces carry the content, which tempting patterns or support surfaces stay outside, and, when several burden branches touch the same carrier set, whether that overlap is valid convergence or one reopened architecture smell. | Maintains an explicit impact/boundary graph for coordinated changes. |
| **CC‑DRR.3a (practical and validation consequences are explicit)** | The Consequences account **MUST** expose the practical change in use, practical gains/costs, affected patterns and governing support surfaces, and any remaining content-level validation burden or authority/release consequence that still constrains the selected decision by value. | Prevents consequences from collapsing into generic optimism or route prose. |
| **CC‑DRR.3b (SoTA shapes the decision when load-bearing)** | When SoTA or competitive positioning is load-bearing, the DRR **MUST** make the current SoTA basis and any uncertainty that would materially change the decision recoverable by value. A literature overview that does not shape the selected answer, boundary, or validation burden is non-conforming. | Keeps SoTA from becoming decorative appendix material. |
| **CC‑DRR.4** | An accepted DRR **SHALL** have its Decision account landed in the Core as the normative change. When that DRR temporarily carries richer convergence content, authors landing it **SHOULD** distribute any part that stabilizes into enduring FPF content into the relevant Core patterns and governing support surfaces. Authors **MAY** distill other DRR sections into **informative** pattern sections (Rationale/Consequences/SoTA‑Echoing/Grounding), but they **SHALL NOT** introduce new normative constraints except via explicit `NORM`/`A`/`D`/`GOV` text. | Preserves Core authority while allowing a richer temporary convergence artefact. |
| **CC‑DRR.4a (separate-law surface proliferation is blocked)** | If the DRR needs compact law/check content, it **SHOULD** keep that content as one decision-law section or as obligations on selected existing amendment targets. It **MUST NOT** mint a separate `law sheet`, `profile`, support surface, or checklist surface unless that separate surface is selected by value and shown not to duplicate the DRR or the selected amendment targets. | Prevents unnecessary separate-surface proliferation and shadow-law duplication. |
| **CC‑DRR.4b (current decision object remains singular)** | A conforming DRR **MUST** remain one current content decision object. It **MUST NOT** carry route/gate/handoff/process posture, mutable status, or hidden same-decision future-planning language; any undecided remainder **MUST** be marked outside the current decision with named pattern/support surface/decision record. | Keeps the DRR ontologically about the FPF decision rather than about the development container. |
| **CC‑DRR.4c (downstream authoring stays inside the accepted decision)** | Authors drafting from an accepted DRR **MAY** elaborate examples, SoTA‑Echoing, recognition surfaces, local wording inside the selected patterns and support surfaces, and neighboring fit, but they **SHALL NOT** silently revise the selected answer, selected patterns and support surfaces, outside-current-decision boundary, reusable-support disposition, or declared loss/recoverability regime. Any such revision **SHALL** be routed through one successor DRR or other named successor decision record. | Keeps later pattern drafting from re-deciding bounded content by drift. |
| **CC‑DRR.4d (major decision gaps are not left to drafting-time invention)** | A conforming DRR **MUST NOT** leave materially live burden-family choices about the governed object, selected patterns and support surfaces, outside-current-decision boundary, reusable-support disposition, or loss/recoverability regime to be discovered case-by-case during later pattern/support drafting. Those choices **MUST** already be selected, rejected, inherited unchanged, or routed outside the current decision with named pattern/support surface/decision record. | Ensures the DRR actually coordinates one bounded change set rather than serving as a thin preface to later rediscovery. |
| **CC‑DRR.5** | A DRR for minor, non‑substantive edits (Δ‑0/Δ‑1; e.g., typos, wording clarity, didactic rearrangements) **MAY** use a lightweight variant containing Problem‑frame (Context) + Decision only (“no semantic change”), provided it does not alter semantics. | Avoids bureaucratic drag on editorial work. |
| **CC‑DRR.6 (evidence boundary)** | For Δ‑2/Δ‑3 lexical or authoring-sensitive changes, the DRR **SHALL** state the content-level evidence or validation burden that bears on the decision, and it **MAY** summarize already-available decisive evidence by value when that evidence materially shapes the chosen content. The DRR **SHALL NOT** need a LAT id, run-manifest id, gate id, packet id, or other authoring-evidence citation in order to count as complete; those remain in the relevant evidence or authoring record. If later LAT or refresh evidence motivates reopening or revising the decision, that later evidence belongs in a successor DRR or other named successor decision record rather than being retrofitted into the accepted DRR. | Keeps the DRR a design-rationale record while preserving re-runnable evidence in its own evidence or authoring record. |

### E.9:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What it looks like | Why it fails | Repair |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Process brief disguised as DRR** | The record explains baton movement, packet posture, review timing, or current campaign state. | It describes development process rather than the FPF content decision. | Remove mutable process state and keep only the substantive basis, selected answer, alternatives, and consequences. |
| **Shadow specification** | The DRR becomes the only place where stable semantics, examples, or support rules live after the Core has moved. | Later FPF readers cannot use the decision because it never became pattern content. | Distribute enduring content into the selected patterns and governing support surfaces; leave the DRR as provenance. |
| **Four-label shell** | The record has Problem frame, Decision, Rationale, and Consequences headings, but no basis, use-value, alternatives, surface distribution, or impact account by value. | The minimum kernel is labeled but not substantively recoverable. | Fill the decision-support surfaces that are live for the decision, or use the lightweight variant only for true `Delta-0` / `Delta-1` edits. |
| **Tentative carrier list** | The DRR says a pattern may need work later, is most likely affected, or should be watched if touched. | A named live distribution question is postponed while pretending to be decided. | Classify each named pattern or support surface now: selected, rejected, inherited unchanged, or outside the current decision with a named record. |
| **Loss without use/reopen rule** | The decision weakens, summarizes, redacts, or simplifies content but does not state supported use, unsupported downstream use, recoverability, and reopen conditions. | A weaker representation can be used as if it were the full source. | Add the loss/recoverability template: preserved distinctions, dropped distinctions, supported uses, unsupported uses, recoverability class, and reopen or exit rule. |
| **Decorative SoTA appendix** | Sources are listed after the fact but do not shape the selected answer, boundary, or validation burden. | The record looks researched while the decision remains unchallenged by current practice. | State what each load-bearing source makes the DRR adopt, adapt, or reject, and which uncertainty would materially change the answer. |
### E.9:9 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Complete audit trail** – every semantic normative change carries a structured “why”. | Adds deliberate friction; mitigated by CC‑DRR.5 (Δ‑0/Δ‑1 lightweight) and CC‑DRR.1a (pointer‑based DRRs). |
| **Higher decision quality** – Pillar, alternatives, scenario, and utility checks surface hidden conflicts early. | Authors must do more real content work up front; the gain is less downstream reinvention and less hidden deferral. |
| **Institutional memory** – prevents re‑litigation of rejected alternatives. | DRR archive grows; index stored in a non‑normative annex. |
| **Executable downstream authoring** – selected patterns and support surfaces, outside-boundary, reusable-support decisions, selected-answer stability, and remaining validation burden are explicit enough for later drafting/landing without semantic invention. | Richer DRRs need discipline to avoid becoming shadow specs or process briefs; mitigated by CC‑DRR.1b, CC‑DRR.4a, CC‑DRR.4b, CC‑DRR.4c, and CC‑DRR.4d. |

### E.9:10 - Rationale
FPF evolves by **explicit, reviewable deltas** rather than silent edits.
The DRR is the *minimum structured argument*—and, when several patterns or
governing support surfaces must move together, an allowed temporary convergence
artefact—that keeps **P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution** compatible with **P‑1
Cognitive Elegance** and **P‑2 Didactic Primacy**.

E.9 sets a **floor, not a ceiling**: every conforming DRR must make
Problem‑frame / Decision / Rationale / Consequences recoverable, but it
may carry richer substantive coordination content when that prevents
shadow documents or semantic invention during distribution into Core patterns and governing support surfaces. The same floor also requires the decision-support content that
later authoring and review otherwise reconstruct manually: exact basis,
use-value, first-minute working situation, scenario basis, alternatives,
current disposition map, naming/ontology burden, selected content distribution,
existing-pattern sufficiency/new-pattern necessity, overlap classification,
selected-answer stability, impact/boundary graph, practical payoff, and
any still-live uncertainty that materially shapes the decision.

Pointer-based DRRs (CC‑DRR.1a) prevent duplicated prose, and distribution
into Core patterns and governing support surfaces (CC‑DRR.4) keeps the specification itself learnable
without turning the DRR into a permanent shadow canon. Process-law route,
gate, and handoff surfaces stay outside because they are not part of the
content answer that FPF is selecting.

### E.9:11 - SoTA-Echoing

`E.9` aligns with contemporary architecture-decision and rationale-capture practice, but adapts that practice to FPF's pattern-governed Core.

| Practice / source family | What FPF adopts, adapts, or rejects | FPF implication |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture-description standards such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022** | **Adopts** the idea that architecture work must make concerns, viewpoints, decisions, and rationale inspectable. **Adapts** it from system architecture descriptions to FPF content deltas and selected pattern/support-surface distribution. | A DRR must expose the concerns and alternatives that shape the FPF change, not only the edited text. |
| **Markdown ADR practice, including post-2015 lightweight ADR/MADR-style templates** | **Adopts** compact context/decision/consequence discipline and version-controlled decision records. **Rejects** treating a generic ADR template as sufficient when a multi-pattern FPF change needs Pillar, lens, naming, SoTA, distribution, or loss/recoverability support. | Minor edits can stay lightweight; semantic amendments need enough by-value support for later pattern drafting without reinvention. |
| **Continuous/evolutionary architecture and decision-record practice** | **Adopts** the view that decision records are revisitable support for evolving systems. **Adapts** it by keeping mutable process state out of the DRR and routing reopened content through a successor decision record. | FPF keeps rationale durable without turning the DRR into a live status log or permanent shadow law. |
| **Research and design-rationale traditions around alternatives and trade-off capture** | **Adopts** explicit comparison of rejected alternatives and trade-offs. **Adapts** it through the Eleven Pillars and Principle-Taxonomy lenses. | The DRR should make why-this-not-that recoverable enough that future authors do not re-litigate or silently reverse the selected answer. |
