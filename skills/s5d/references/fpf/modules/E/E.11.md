## E.11 - First-Practical Entry and Pattern-Use Discoverability Discipline

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

### E.11:1 - Problem frame

One cold reader often enters `FPF` with one burden phrase rather than one
pattern ID. The reader may see several plausible patterns, one search result,
one `Preface` blurb, one `J.4` row, or one local pattern opening, but still not
know which authoritative pattern to inspect first, which nearby pattern is only
support or a tempting wrong first stop, and where it is lawful to stop reading
for entry purposes.

Pattern-entry discoverability is the discipline that makes that first
recognition honest without turning the pattern language into workflow.

Use this pattern when the reader can name the burden in ordinary work language
but still cannot tell which pattern to inspect first, which nearby pattern is
only support, and where the first lawful entry stop belongs.

What goes wrong if this pattern is missed:

- `Preface`, `README`, `J.4`, one search result, or one local top is treated as
  if it were the authoritative pattern rather than one projection or support
  role;
- one plausible nearby pattern becomes a hidden required next step because
  entry language turns into workflow language;
- lexical support turns into synonym stuffing instead of governed query cues;
- readers repeat the same wrong first guesses because the corpus never
  publishes one explicit entry-neighborhood discipline.

What this pattern buys:

- the first honest burden becomes nameable near the point of use;
- candidate patterns, tempting wrong patterns, and lawful entry stops become
  visible without minting a workflow;
- support/projection roles can help the reader recover the right pattern
  without competing for semantic authority.

Ordinary not-this-pattern boundary:

- not when the real burden is first-contact recognition of one single
  encountered description; use `A.6.RSIG`;
- not when the real burden is already one published route, language-state cue,
  endpoint publication line, or work sequence;
- not when the authoritative pattern is already known and the remaining job is
  only didactic order or lexical repair;
- not when a formal quality claim about discoverability is being made; route
  that burden through `C.25` / `A.6.Q` as applicable.

### E.11:2 - Problem

Pattern-entry discoverability burdens are spread across `Preface`, `J.4`,
`I.2`, local pattern `Problem frame`s, table-of-content query rows, and
lexical-support patterns. Without one governing pattern for their split, readers
can infer false sequence, wrong pattern, wrong strongest home, or shadow
projection authority because the support roles are under-governed.

### E.11:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| High recall vs high precision | Coarse orientation helps the reader enter quickly without creating false confidence or false sequence. |
| Local fit vs corpus consistency | Pattern-local cues stay honest while the corpus avoids stale echoes and duplicated strong guidance. |
| Subject-domain wording vs canonical wording | Readers search in real phrases, but canonical names and governed distinctions stay lawful. |
| Quick orientation vs anti-workflow discipline | Entry support helps pattern selection without reading like route execution, handoff, or pipeline. |
| Reader economy vs fanout control | More support roles can help entry, but repeated near-duplicate guidance creates contradiction risk and maintenance burden. |
| Human and AI-assisted retrieval vs authority | Retrieval may return helpful fragments, but fragments must not answer as if they were the strongest home. |

### E.11:4 - Solution

#### E.11:4.1 - Governed object, non-goals, and non-minting boundary

`E.11` governs pattern-entry discoverability for `FPF` and
`FPF`-conformant pattern-language authoring: the coordination law by which one
reader can bring plausible authoritative patterns into view, compare them,
reject tempting wrong patterns and wrong strongest homes, use lawful
projection/support roles, and reach one lawful entry stop or burden
reclassification without reading the pattern language as workflow.

In `E.11`, the live governed case is pattern-entry discoverability. Description
discoverability remains routed through `A.6.RSIG`; `E.11` mentions it only to
preserve the semantic-name settlement and support-role partition.

`E.11` does not govern:

- discoverability trigger-word repair or naming assets that belong to
  `A.6.P / F.18 / E.10`;
- description-recognition signatures in general, which belong to `A.6.RSIG`;
- local first-reading placement and form, which belong to `E.8`;
- didactic order, learning order, cognitive-load ramping, tutorial sequence,
  progressive mastery, and teaching examples after the relevant pattern family
  has already been identified;
- workflows, process routes, control-flow graphs, prescribed method sequences,
  work handoffs, or runtime execution stops;
- the semantic content of referenced patterns;
- formal quality treatment, which belongs to `C.25` / `A.6.Q` when the claim
  becomes evaluative;
- graph ontology in `E.18`.

This pattern does not mint one new `U.Discoverability`, `RelationKind`,
`PatternKind`, `StatusKind`, `SurfaceKind`, graph node, or workflow state.

#### E.11:4.2 - Pattern-entry discoverability claim and FPF strata

Pattern-entry discoverability is one composite quality-facing concern over
whether one reader can:

- bring the right candidate patterns into view, together with any lawful
  support roles needed for comparison;
- recognize applicability or non-applicability;
- avoid common wrong patterns, wrong strongest homes, or projection-only
  fragments answered as if they were authoritative;
- reach one lawful entry stop or burden reclassification.

This pattern keeps these semantic heads distinct:

| Head | Working meaning here |
| --- | --- |
| `pattern-entry discoverability` | one composite entry quality over a support/projection stack inside a pattern language |
| `description-recognition signature` | one first-contact cue structure of one encountered description, governed by `A.6.RSIG` |
| `first-reading role` | the local reading job carried by an existing pattern section or projection; not a new surface kind |
| `lexical-query support` | cue-to-home access through the reader's words, domain phrases, and query cues without alias minting |
| `worked entry reading` | one explanatory reading case, not `U.Work`, not a workflow, and not an execution trace |
| `entry neighborhood` | one case-relative editorial grouping or `J.4` row, not a graph node, route, selector output, or object kind |
| `thin echo` | lower-case projection discipline: a reminder or pointer, not a `U.Type`, publication-face kind, or authority relation |

None of those heads is a synonym for the others. This pattern routes each
effect to its strongest home or strongest projection role rather than letting
`discoverability` become one semantic swamp.

Reader-facing entry language speaks primarily in pattern-language terms:
`candidate pattern`, `nearby pattern`, `tempting wrong pattern`, `burden
reclassification`, `lawful entry stop`, `thin echo`, and `strongest home`.

`owner` and `ownership` are not default reader-facing terms here. Use them only
in process-law owner-set contexts or explicit authority-conflict diagnostics.

#### E.11:4.3 - Pattern-language navigation stance and case-orientation snapshot

An `entry neighborhood` is one case-relative editorial grouping of plausible
candidate patterns, nearby patterns, common misclassifications, burden
reclassifications, and lawful entry stops under one first honest burden.

`candidate patterns` here are case-plausible patterns to inspect under one
named burden. They are not `OptionSet`s, candidate pools, selected sets, or
selector outputs unless another authoritative pattern explicitly promotes that
structure.

`nearby pattern` means case-near for recognition, disambiguation, or burden
reclassification. It does not mean next, required, dependent, broader,
narrower, or pedagogically prior.

Authors can use one lower-case `case-orientation snapshot` as an editorial lens
over the current cues, current burden hypothesis, plausible candidate patterns,
tempting wrong pattern, disambiguating fact, lawful entry stop, and current
reading role. It is not one canonical persisted object and does not create a
transition history.

Minimal example:

```text
case_signal = "we need a shortlist, not one winner"
current_burden_hypothesis = selected-set publication or candidate-pool policy
plausible_candidate_patterns = C.19; G.5 only when selected-set publication is live
nearby_patterns_or_reclassifications = C.11, C.24, A.19 comparator/selector supports
tempting_wrong_pattern = C.11
disambiguating_fact = output remains a governed set, not one local choice
lawful_entry_stop = inspect C.19 if pool policy is live; inspect G.5 if publication is live; inspect C.11/C.24 only after the burden narrows

```

#### E.11:4.4 - Entry-orientation labels and burden reclassification discipline

The local `FPF` application of this pattern is the coordination law for
first-practical entry orientation over the `FPF` pattern language: support-role
partition, entry-bearing vs nearby-pattern discipline, burden-reclassification
presentation, thin-echo discipline, entry-lexeme-support hooks, and review
hooks.

Route-shaped wording can blur entry orientation with lawful publication seams,
early language-state routing, endpoint publication, `A.6.B` routed claim
structure, `DRR` claim routing, or actual method/work sequencing. Repair that
blur by typing the live burden explicitly rather than by treating every
route-shaped phrase as entry guidance.

Use this placement test whenever one pattern-entry discoverability-bearing
claim or wording repair is being placed:

| If the claim is about... | Route it to... |
| --- | --- |
| first surfacing candidate material through reader words, domain phrases, or query cues | lexical-query support under `F.17 / F.18 / E.10`, coordinated by `E.11` only where the pattern-entry burden is live |
| one description's first-contact recognition, truthful applicability signal, or authoritative home | `A.6.RSIG` |
| choosing among patterns, candidate patterns, nearby patterns, wrong strongest homes, or burden reclassifications inside the pattern language | `E.11` |
| the lawful local `Problem frame` first-reading role, reading order, or recognition/assurance relation | `E.8` |
| review trigger, evidence-mode selection, or cross-role parity checks for one pattern-entry discoverability-bearing change | `E.19 / PCP-ENTRY` |
| one compact or worked projection of already-governed pattern-entry discoverability content | `J.4`, `I.2`, `Preface`, the pattern `Problem frame`, or lexical support according to the strongest-home map |
| the order in which one already-identified area is learned or taught | `E.6`, `E.7`, `E.12`, `F.16`, and the appropriate tutorial views or walkthroughs |
| route-bearing publication of cues, route pressure, or endpoint publication | `A.16`, `A.16.1`, `B.4.1`, or the relevant publication pattern |
| one actual work sequence, method, plan, artifact output, or execution stop | the relevant method/work pattern rather than `E.11` |
| the meaning of the actual pattern, method, boundary description, or other governed object | the relevant authoritative pattern or governing support surface rather than the entry support role |

`E.11` uses only lower-case editorial labels when reviewers need a compact
diagnostic vocabulary:

- entry-orientation labels: `candidate-pattern`, `nearby-pattern`,
  `burden-reclassification`, `common-misclassification`;
- projection-support labels: `lexical-support`, `worked-reading-expansion`;
- entry-posture labels: `entry-bearing`, `participant-only`,
  `burden-critical`;
- projection-purpose labels: `global-entry orientation role`,
  `catalogue-search support role`, `entry-neighborhood index role`,
  `worked-entry-reading support role`, `Problem-frame recognition role`,
  `entry-lexeme support role`, `review-profile role`, `assurance role`.

These labels are optional reviewer/editor vocabulary. They are not exported
kind families and are not required authoring dimensions for ordinary pattern
repairs.

#### E.11:4.5 - Support-role partition, Problem-frame first-reading discipline, and README boundary

The concrete `FPF` application uses distinct support/projection roles:

- `Preface` gives coarse global orientation;
- `Table of Content` `Keywords & Search Queries` gives sparse
  catalogue-search and lexical-query support;
- `J.4` gives compact entry-neighborhood comparison;
- `I.2` gives worked entry readings for high-risk or compact-insufficient
  cases;
- the pattern's own `Problem frame` gives the primary local first-reading role;
- `F.17 / F.18 / E.10` carry entry-lexeme support;
- `README` can echo the Core entry architecture and point to `Preface`, `J.4`,
  `I.2`, and selected pattern families.

`README` remains downstream of Core and does not introduce entry neighborhoods,
candidate patterns, or lexical names absent from Core. It changes when public
entry claims change materially, not for every internal local wording repair.

Canonical entry neighborhoods can use compact lexical-query support when the
lexical burden is real. Query cues are retrieval aids, not aliases, Bridges,
equivalence claims, or semantic twins. A query cue becomes an alias only through
the relevant lexical/naming home.

Minimal visible lexical-query shape:

```text
canonical_label
plain_twin_if_governed
visible_query_cues
domain_query_examples
deprecated_cues
false_friends_or_forbidden_synonyms
```

Ordinary lexical-query support stays sparse:

- ordinary `Table of Content` rows: prefer `2-5` high-signal query phrases;
- ordinary `J.4` neighborhoods: keep only the strongest domain phrases and
  false friends;
- fuller lexical sets belong under `F.17 / F.18 / E.10` only when one real
  naming, alias, bridge, or collision burden exists.

#### E.11:4.6 - Fanout, thin-echo discipline, and semantic parity

Each entry/discoverability claim names one strongest home or strongest
projection role. Other mentions remain thin echoes.

| Claim payload | Strongest home / projection role | Thin echoes allowed in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| trigger-word repair and naming fix | `A.6.P` / `F.18` / `E.10` | quoted local reminders only when needed for user safety |
| description-recognition-signature claim | `A.6.RSIG` | one bounded publication/view cue under `E.17` when needed |
| compact entry-neighborhood row | `J.4` | `Preface`, README, one pattern's `Problem frame` |
| worked entry reading | `I.2` | one compact `J.4` pointer |
| local first-use recognition cue | the pattern `Problem frame` under `E.8` | `J.4` as cross-pattern comparison |
| lexical-query cue | `F.17 / F.18 / E.10` or a bounded ToC/J.4 support hook | `I.2`, README, and local prose only as sparse cues |

Support-role parity means semantic consistency of first-use burden, strongest
home or strongest projection role, wrong-pattern boundary, projection-only
status, and no claim stronger than the Core pattern body. It does not require
identical wording, identical examples, identical rows, or exhaustive coverage
across all support/projection roles.

#### E.11:4.7 - Change propagation, compact host-note discipline, and `PCP-ENTRY` hook

Authors do not introduce `Entry-orientation account` as a standalone artifact
family.

For material entry/discoverability changes, the author leaves one compact host
note inside the `DRR`, `PCP` record, patch note, or equivalent host record.
Ordinary wording repairs do not require a separate note when candidate-pattern
force, first honest burden, strongest home or strongest projection role, and
support role remain unchanged.

Allowed host-note shape:

```text
Entry-change note:
changed projection or support role:
changed first-use burden:
strongest home / projection role:
wrong-pattern or parity risk:
selected check, if any:
```

If the note takes more than a few lines for an ordinary material entry change,
the change is probably too large for a local note or should escalate to a real
`DRR` / `PCP` record.

`PCP-ENTRY` is the narrow additive review profile for material
pattern-entry-discoverability changes. It is risk-triggered rather than
universal and reviews only entry-facing effects.

A pattern does not need a `J.4` row merely because it exists. A `J.4` row is
needed only when the pattern or neighborhood is a likely first practical entry,
a common wrong first guess, or a public/retrieval-facing entry point.

`I.2` worked readings are rare-depth. A compact-index-only posture is a
complete lawful entry result when the `J.4` row plus pattern `Problem frame` are
enough for the burden.

#### E.11:4.7.1 - Minimum viable entry discipline

For an ordinary entry-bearing pattern change, the minimum is:

1. the `Problem frame` names the working situation;
2. it names or implies the first candidate pattern/home;
3. it rejects one tempting wrong reading if that risk is live;
4. it does not imply workflow, handoff, or route order;
5. any support role remains a thin echo.

Everything else is triggered:

- `J.4` row: only if it is a likely first entry or common wrong first guess;
- `I.2` worked reading: only if compact guidance repeatedly fails or risk is
  high;
- ToC lexical cues: only if search/query support is material;
- README/Preface echo: only if public entry changes materially;
- host note: only for material entry-force changes;
- evidence mode: only for high-risk, disputed, retrieval-facing,
  repeated-failure, or measured-improvement claims.

### E.11:5 - Archetypal grounding

#### E.11:5.1 - System-side worked entry repair: shortlist burden, not one-off choice

Live reader phrase:

> "We need a shortlist, not one winner."

Why the phrase is easy to mishandle:

- `C.11` looks tempting because a local decision may eventually happen;
- `G.5` looks tempting because publication may happen later;
- `C.24` can be nearby when the missing object is a tool-call plan;
- one reader can mistake the live burden for a required next step in a hidden
  selection workflow.

Entry repair:

1. first honest burden = selected-set shaping, candidate-pool policy, or
   selected-set publication, not automatically one-off local choice;
2. plausible candidate patterns = `A.19.CN`, `A.17-A.19`, `C.18`, `C.19`,
   `G.0`, and `G.5` when selected-set publication is already live;
3. nearby / burden-reclassification patterns = `C.11` only after the burden
   narrows to one local decision doctrine, `C.24` only when the next honest
   artifact is a call plan or checkpoint return, and `A.19.CPM` /
   `A.19.SelectorMechanism` when comparator/selector structure is live;
4. disambiguating fact = the desired output remains a governed set or
   shortlist rather than one local winner;
5. lawful entry stop = inspect `C.19` if pool/candidate policy is live; inspect
   `G.5` if selected-set publication is already live; inspect `C.11` or `C.24`
   only after that narrower burden is actually live.


#### E.11:5.2 - Episteme-side anti-case: partly-said cue is not yet a claim

Live reader phrase:

> "This phrase matters, but it is not yet a claim."

Plausible but wrong first reading:

- the reader jumps straight to `A.6.P`, `A.6.Q`, `A.6.A`, or `C.25` because
  the phrase sounds conceptually important.

Entry repair:

1. first honest burden = cue preservation and burden typing, not endpoint claim
   publication;
2. plausible candidate patterns = `C.2.LS`, `A.16`, `A.16.1`, `B.4.1`,
   `B.5.2.0`;
3. tempting wrong pattern = any endpoint claim, action, or quality pattern that
   assumes the cue is already stable enough to publish as a claim;
4. lawful entry stop = cue preserved, entry plurality opened, or burden
   reclassified honestly; if the phrase is already a boundary claim, inspect
   `A.6.B` / `A.6.C` instead.

#### E.11:5.3 - Episteme-side worked entry repair: same-entity rewrite

Live reader phrase:

> "We need to explain the same thing for another audience."

Entry repair:

1. first honest burden = same-entity retextualization, representation-scheme
   transition, explanation-facing rendering, or bounded comparative reading;
2. plausible candidate patterns = `A.6.3.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, `E.17.EFP`,
   `E.17.ID.CR`;
3. tempting wrong pattern = minting one second semantic object or parallel rule
   lane;
4. disambiguating fact = the governed object stays the same; only rendering,
   reading posture, or explanatory framing changes;
5. lawful entry stop = same-entity rewrite opened or explanation-facing
   rendering stabilized with source pins.

#### E.11:5.4 - Quick compact-index-only examples

- **Project alignment.** If the first burden is responsibility/method/plan vs
  run confusion, `A.15` and neighboring work/role patterns are likely first
  homes; `F.17` is a typical vocabulary stabilizer when vocabulary is
  unstable. This can stay compact-index-only unless repeated readers confuse it
  with the whole FPF method.
- **Generator / SoTA / portfolio kit.** If the first deliverable is a reusable
  search/harvest/portfolio scaffold, inspect `A.0`, `G.0`, `G.1`, `G.2`, and
  `G.5`. This can stay compact-index-only unless portfolio/generator entry is
  repeatedly misclassified as one-off recommendation.

### E.11:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern counters:

- workflow bias;
- programmer's-bias graph language;
- front-door centralization bias;
- synonym-soup bias;
- support-projection authority bias;
- owner-bias in reader-facing entry language.

### E.11:7 - Conformance checklist

- **CC-E11-0 Affordability.** Entry guidance is non-conforming when it becomes
  more expensive to author, review, or read than the discoverability risk
  warrants.
- **CC-E11-1 No workflow.** Entry prose does not imply mandatory sequence,
  handoff, route execution, baton transfer, control state, or artifact
  pipeline.
- **CC-E11-2 Pattern authority.** Entry support roles do not redefine the
  semantic content of the authoritative pattern.
- **CC-E11-3 Strongest home / thin echo.** Each entry/discoverability claim has
  one strongest home or strongest projection role; other mentions remain thin
  echoes.
- **CC-E11-4 Pattern-language vocabulary.** Reader-facing entry prose uses
  candidate patterns, nearby patterns, tempting wrong patterns, burden
  reclassification, and lawful entry stop rather than next-step vocabulary.
- **CC-E11-4a Editorial labels only.** Entry labels in `E.11` are editorial
  projection labels over existing patterns, sections, rows, or publication
  faces. They do not create `PatternKind`, `RelationKind`, `StatusKind`,
  `SurfaceKind`, `Role`, `U.Type`, graph node, or workflow state.
- **CC-E11-5 Problem-frame first-reading role.** Local first-use recognition
  remains in the pattern's `Problem frame`; `J.4`, `I.2`, lexical support, and
  `README` do not become competing local recognition homes.
- **CC-E11-6 Quality boundary.** Formal quality claims about discoverability or
  recognition route through `C.25` / `A.6.Q` as applicable; `E.11` coordinates
  pattern-entry use, not quality authority.
- **CC-E11-7 Semantic parity.** Multi-role changes keep burden, authority,
  boundary, and projection-only status compatible without requiring identical
  wording or exhaustive coverage.
- **CC-E11-8 Worked reading threshold.** High-risk, often-misclassified,
  repeatedly failed, retrieval-facing, or materially new entry neighborhoods
  have either one worked entry reading or one explicit compact-index-only
  posture.
- **CC-E11-9 Lexical-query support.** Material lexical divergence is handled
  through governed lexical-query support, not synonym stuffing or alias
  equivalence.
- **CC-E11-10 Retrieval-facing claim.** Retrieval fixtures are used only when
  retrieval behavior is explicitly claimed, observed to fail, or
  machine-facing projection support is in scope.

### E.11:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Problem-frame absence.** The pattern body is lawful, but the first-use
  situation is still unclear. Repair by rewriting the `Problem frame` for the
  first-reading role.
- **Top overgrowth.** The opening carries architecture placement, token guards,
  route fields, or law before the working situation is clear. Repair by moving
  heavy material to `Solution`, `Relations`, `Conformance`, or `I.2`.
- **Route smuggling.** Local text says `Start here`, `next owner`, `handoff`, or
  `reroute` as if it were a sequence. Repair by replacing it with candidate
  patterns, nearby patterns, burden reclassification, and lawful entry stop.
- **Shadow projection.** `J.4`, `README`, or another projection defines pattern
  semantics. Repair by moving that definition back to the authoritative pattern
  and leaving only one thin echo.
- **Lexical stuffing.** Pattern bodies fill themselves with synonyms for
  findability. Repair by routing lexical support through `F.17 / F.18 / E.10`.
- **Entry-block-as-ontology.** A temporary map of neighborhoods is frozen as if
  it were one stable ontology. Repair by keeping neighborhoods case-relative
  and projection-scoped.

### E.11:9 - Consequences

This pattern gives `FPF` one explicit coordination law for pattern-entry
discoverability instead of leaving the burden fragmented across `Preface`,
`J.4`, `I.2`, pattern tops, query rows, and lexical support lanes.

It also imposes discipline: entry support becomes thinner, more explicit about
its authoritative patterns and support roles, and less tolerant of
workflow-shaped wording. The cost stays bounded because worked readings,
host notes, parity scans, retrieval fixtures, and evidence modes are triggered
by risk rather than required for ordinary wording repairs.

### E.11:10 - Rationale

This pattern is needed because the burden is no longer only local pattern form
and not only lexical repair. `E.8` governs local first-reading form;
`A.6.RSIG` governs the neutral description-recognition-signature substrate;
`E.19` reviews risk-triggered entry changes. The cross-pattern entry law still
needs its own governing pattern.

### E.11:11 - SoTA-Echoing

This pattern is an `FPF`-local pattern-entry discipline. It adopts current
discoverability, documentation-mode, taxonomy, pattern-validation,
human/AI-facing, and retrieval practices only where they preserve one
burden-oriented entry reading over a pattern language. It rejects turning that
reading into one workflow, front door, route graph, synonym store, or
retrieval-tooling ontology.

| Pattern claim carried here | Source-bearing SoTA support (post-2015) | Alignment with `E.11` | Adoption status and worked-slice implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pattern-entry starts from first honest burden and candidate-pattern recognition, not chapter order or route execution. | Jorge Arango (2018), *Living in Information: Responsible Design for Digital Places*; Raluca Budiu (2020), "Information Scent: How Users Decide Where to Go Next", Nielsen Norman Group. | Information-architecture practice supports orientation through places, labels, context, and reader expectations. `E.11` adopts scent as first-contact cue economy, then strengthens it into semantic-home recovery, tempting-wrong-pattern rejection, burden reclassification, and lawful entry stop. | **Adopt / strengthen.** Adopt cue economy and burden-oriented orientation; reject scent, familiar wording, or a retrieved support echo as sufficient semantic authority. In the shortlist case, the manager distinguishes selected-set publication, candidate-pool policy, and one-off choice before opening the wrong pattern. |
| Pattern-entry support needs role partition: coarse orientation, compact index, worked reading, local first-reading role, and lexical support are different jobs. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022; Daniele Procida, *Diataxis* documentation framework (2017-2025). | User-information and documentation-mode practice separates information needs and presentation modes. `E.11` extends this from documentation form to semantic-home recovery and wrong-pattern rejection. | **Adapt.** Adopt mode separation; reject replacing pattern authority with documentation architecture. Practitioners get compact rows in `J.4`, worked readings in `I.2`, and local recognition in the authoritative pattern. |
| Entry lexemes and query cues need controlled governance, but lexical support is not alias minting and not semantic equivalence. | Helen Lippell, ed. (2022), *Taxonomies: Practical Approaches to Developing and Managing Vocabularies for Digital Information*. | Taxonomy practice supports governed terms, validation, and maintenance for search, browse, and interpretation. `E.11` routes query cues, false friends, and plain twins through `F.17 / F.18 / E.10`, `J.4`, `I.2`, and ToC rows instead of stuffing synonyms into every pattern body. | **Adapt.** Adopt lexical-query discipline; reject uncontrolled alias growth. In the partly-said anti-case, subject-language cues help find the neighborhood while the cue remains not-yet-claim. |
| Human and AI-assisted readers need clear capability, limitation, and uncertainty cues. | Amershi et al. (2019), "Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction", CHI 2019. | Human-AI guidance validates the need to make capabilities and limits clear enough for calibration. `E.11` adapts this into public and machine-assisted entry: thin echoes say what they can point to and what they cannot define, while `A.6.RSIG` fields such as applies-to, excludes, authoritative home, and lawful entry stop calibrate what an encountered description can and cannot settle. | **Adapt / narrow.** Adopt expectation management for mixed human/AI reading; reject an AI-interface pattern. README and `Preface` should say "typical entry-stabilizing result" rather than promise guaranteed outputs, and the `E.19` LLM-retrieved-paragraph case should recover the strongest home instead of letting a helpful fragment answer as authority. |
| Pattern-entry claims need accountable case-linked validation and selected evidence, but evidence cost is risk-triggered. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, and Barcomb (2020), *Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods*. | Pattern-validation practice supports explicit evidence beyond folklore. `E.11` adapts this into `PCP-ENTRY`, worked-entry readings, wrong-pattern checks, compact host notes, tiny golden cases, and selected evidence only when entry force, semantic support-role parity, public-entry risk, repeated failure, or retrieval-facing behavior warrants them. | **Adopt / lightweight.** Adopt accountable case-linked validation; reject universal empirical validation or heavy fixture work for ordinary wording or support-role/projection edits. |
| Retrieval-facing entry support must distinguish successful retrieval from correct pattern selection and faithful source use. | Lewis et al. (2020), "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks"; Liu, Zhang, and Liang (2023), "Evaluating Verifiability in Generative Search Engines"; Gao et al. (2023), "Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations"; Asai et al. (2024), "Self-RAG"; Saad-Falcon et al. (2023), "ARES"; Es et al. (2023), "RAGAS"; Wallat et al. (2024/2025), work on correctness versus faithfulness in `RAG` attributions. | Current retrieval and citation work distinguishes context relevance, retrieved support, citation precision/recall, answer faithfulness, attribution faithfulness, post-rationalized citation-like support, and adaptive retrieval. `E.11` adapts that into strongest-home / thin-echo hygiene and selected retrieval fixtures that distinguish pattern hit, support-role hit, source faithfulness, projection-vs-home ambiguity, stale-echo absence, and thin-echo anchor presence. | **Adapt / risk-triggered.** Adopt the hit/support/authority/faithfulness split; reject universal RAG benchmarking and reject citation-like support as authority by itself. In the "LLM retrieved a helpful paragraph but not the pattern" case, the repair is to recover the strongest home, not to bless the fragment as authority. |
