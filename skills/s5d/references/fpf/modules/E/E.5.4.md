## E.5.4 - Cross‑Disciplinary Bias Audit

### E.5.4:1 - Problem frame
FPF calls itself trans‑disciplinary, but every author carries implicit
metaphors from a home domain. If those metaphors leak into “universal”
patterns, practitioners from other fields disengage or mis‑interpret the
rules.

### E.5.4:2 - Problem
Unrecognised bias hides in wording, examples, unit choices or principle
weighting. Once embedded in normative language, such bias is hard to
remove and contradicts Pillars **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** and **P‑8
Cross‑Scale Consistency**.

### E.5.4:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Neutrality** | One voice for all disciplines ↔ need for relatable examples. |
| **Conciseness** | Audit guidance must be brief ↔ must cover multiple bias types. |
| **Longevity** | Guidance must survive emergence of new domains. |

### E.5.4:4 - Solution — Principle‑Taxonomy‑Guided Bias Audit

1. **Bias‑Lens set**  
   Every normative pattern is assessed through **five lenses** that match the
   Principle classes from **E.3**:  
   `Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`.

2. **Equilibrium question**  
   For each lens ask:  
   *“Does the pattern over‑privilege this class or silence it?”*  
   *Examples:*  
   *   Over‑reliance on `Onto/Epist` precision may ignore `Prag` cost.  
   *   Dominant `Arch` metaphors may alienate `Did` audiences.

3. **Scope‑or‑Balance rule**  
   * If imbalance is found and universality is intended, re‑phrase to
     restore balance.  
   * If imbalance is intentional (domain‑specific pattern), mark the
     scope explicitly: *“Applies primarily to thermodynamic systems.”*

4. **Audit trace**  
   The pattern carries a short **Bias‑Annotation** paragraph recording
   which lenses were tested and any scoping statement. No workflow checklists or
   reviewer metadata or other data and data format and data governance tips is stored in the Core.

### E.5.4:5 - Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Bias lens | Example imbalance | Conceptual correction |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| `Arch` vs `Did` | Pump pattern uses abstract category theory terms. | Add plain‑language boundary narrative or move abstraction to appendix. |
| `Onto/Epist` vs `Prag` | Episteme trust score defined with complex logic but no guidance on empirical cost. | Add pragmatic note on evidence collection burden or scope the pattern. |

### E.5.4:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑BA.1** | Each Core pattern **SHALL** include a *Bias‑Annotation* listing the five lenses and any declared scope limitation. | Ensures explicit reflection on bias. |
| **CC‑BA.2** | A pattern labelled “universal” **MUST NOT** privilege a single lens without justification or scoping note. | Preserves trans‑disciplinary integrity. |
| **CC‑BA.3** | If scope is declared, the pattern **SHALL** reference the mapping or rationale that enables cross‑domain translation. | Keeps pathways open for other calculi. |
| **CC‑BA.4 (QD‑triad evidence for “universal”).** | Any pattern that labels itself **“universal”** SHALL cite **A.8 CC‑UC 1 + CC‑UC 2** and attach the **QD evidence** (Diversity_P + IlluminationSummary, with edition and binning) or else **scope** the claim to its home Context. | preserves domain quality diversity |

### E.5.4:7 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Neutral, inclusive language attracts wider adoption. | Authors spend a few extra lines on Bias‑Annotation; mitigated by template snippet. |
| Bias is surfaced at writing time, not after publication. | — |

### E.5.4:8 - Rationale
Coupling the audit directly to the Principle Taxonomy keeps the guard‑rail
**concept‑driven**, not workflow‑driven. No mention of review boards,
CI‑jobs, or checklists appears in the Core; such mechanics belong in the
Tooling Guide. This guard‑rail therefore satisfies **GR‑1** (Firewall)
while securing Pillars **P‑2, P‑7 Pragmatic Utility, P‑8**.

### E.5.4:9 - Relations
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitution/principle‑taxonomy` (E.3)  
* **Constrains:** All normative patterns claiming universality
