## B.5.2.1 - Creative Abduction with NQD

**Status.** Normative **binding** to **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** that delegates candidate generation to **Γ_nqd.generate** (**C.18 NQD-CAL**) and exploration/exploitation policy to **E/E-LOG (C.19)**; the kernel remains unchanged.

**Non‑duplication & parsimony.** “Introduces **no new kernel primitives**; reuses the CHR kit (**A.17/A.18**) to define measurable **Characteristics**. This pattern does not introduce new eligibility conditions. Application is permitted only when USM coverage holds for the target slice and the performer’s RSG state is enactable (eligibility), without prescribing any team workflow. Per **A.11 Ontological Parsimony**, only a context‑local CHR import and a **Method** are added; **no changes to Γ/LOG**. All generation is performed via **Γ_nqd.* (C.18)** and all exploration/exploitation control via **E/E-LOG (C.19)**. 
**Terminology discipline.** Use **NQD** consistently (Novelty–Quality–Diversity). Treat **S**/**I** as *secondary* metrics unless explicitly promoted by policy (see §3, §5).

### B.5.2.1:1 - **Problem Frame**
* **Conceptual binding:** **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** (this pattern specifies the *how* for Steps 2–3).
* **FPF pattern:** a domain‑neutral **Creativity‑CHR** (C‑cluster) that declares the **Characteristics** used here (see §2). (No change to Γ/LOG.) This binding also references **C.18 NQD-CAL** (operators Γ_nqd.*) and **C.19 E/E-LOG** (EmitterPolicy).
* **Manager’s mental model (informative):** “We add measurable characteristics for *newness*, *spread*, and *fit*, then use a generator that explores widely and returns a **front over the declared Q components** together with retained exploration/archive evidence when the policy asks for it, not a single winner and not one bundled `{Q,N,D}` default.”
* **Operational loops:** compatible with **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** (ideas generated here flow into Run→Observe→Refine→Deploy) and with **B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle** (ADI), preserving abductive primacy. 
* **Decision-subject note.** Later choices are attributed to one declared `DecisionSubject` at explicit `DecisionSubjectGranularity`. **Contexts publish** measurement spaces and admissible policies as **semantic frames**; they do **not** enact choices.

### B.5.2.1:2 - Intent & Problem

**Intent.** Turn Step 2 (*generate*) and Step 3 (*filter*) of the Abductive Loop from ad‑hoc brainstorming into a **disciplined, instrumented exploration** that can (i) *produce many* distinct, plausible hypotheses and (ii) *surface the few worth pursuing*—*without* bloating the kernel or forcing a specific creative method.

**Problem.** Unstructured ideation routinely fails on two fronts: it either produces *too little variety* (pet ideas win by seniority) or *too little plausibility* (grand theories with no testable predictions). **B.5.2** names these failure modes; this pattern adds a minimal, measurable counter‑mechanism aligned to FPF’s assurance lanes and state machine.

### B.5.2.1:3 - The **Creativity‑CHR** (references only; no re‑definitions here)

This binding **references** the context‑local **Creativity‑CHR** (see **C.17**) and **does not** restate measurement templates. The primary coordinates are:
• **`Novelty@context`** (C.17 §5.1), • **`ΔDiversity_P`** (marginal; C.17 §5.5), and • **`Q` components** (per A.18).  
**`Surprise`** and **`Illumination`** are **secondary**: Illumination is **report‑only telemetry** (published as **`IlluminationSummary`** over `Diversity_P`); both act as **tie‑breakers** unless explicitly promoted by policy (C.19).  
**`Use‑Value`** (*alias:* `ValueGain`) is **informative for decision lenses** (Decsn‑CAL) and **MUST NOT** enter NQD dominance by default (see C.17 §5.2).

All listed **Characteristics** are **context‑local** with explicit units/ranges and **polarity↑**. They are *measurements*, not eligibility conditions; eligibility conditions are supplied by **USM/RSG**. (Complies with **A.18** measurement discipline; does not overload assurance semantics.)

> **Lexical discipline.** The items above are **Characteristics** in the sense of **A.17/A.18**; avoid reserved names such as “validity” or “operation.”
> **Normalization note.** If a **QualityVector** has heterogeneous units, Contexts SHALL normalize or nondimensionalize each component before Pareto analysis (see CC‑B.5.2.1‑7).
> **D vs I (normative).** **D = ΔDiversity_P** (marginal gain) is measured for archive quality, tie-breaking, and policy-promoted dominance only. By default it is **not** in the primary `DominanceSet`. **I** is _portfolio illumination_ (report/visual); it **SHALL NOT** be part of the primary dominance test and is usable **only** as an explicit tie-break per policy.
> **Measurement invariants.** Distances, grids, and transforms MUST be declared once per run, versioned, and referenced from provenance (§3, §5).

### B.5.2.1:4 - Solution — **Binding to Γ_nqd.generate (C.18)**

**Method name (Plain/Unified Tech).** *NQD‑Generate* — a **U.Method** that, given (i) a **HypothesisSpace** and (ii) a **CharacteristicSpace** with a **CoverageGrid**, returns a *finite* candidate package: a current **front over the declared `DominanceSet`** plus the retained archive/tie-break telemetry needed to keep diversity and novelty reviewable without making them default dominance dimensions.

**Minimal signature.**

* **Inputs (declared in MethodDescription):**
 `HypothesisSpace`, `CharacteristicSpace`, `Seeds?`, `Budget (time/compute)`, `EmitterPolicy` (**E/E-LOG policy id**), `QualityMeasures (Q components)`, `NoveltyMetric`, `CoverageGrid/Granularity`, `CellCapacity K? (default=1)`, `EpsilonDominance ε? (default=0)`, `TieBreakPolicy? (S/I)`, `DedupThreshold?`, `Policy(TimeWindow)`, `DeterminismSeed?`
 
* **Outputs:**
  CandidateSet = {h_i: (desc_i, Q_i, N_i, D_i:=ΔDiversity_P(h_i | Pool), S_i, I_i, UseValue_i?), genealogy_i?, provenance_i (including **DHCMethodRef.edition** and **policyId** from E/E-LOG)} where `Q_i` is a vector and `provenance_i` captures generator settings and evaluation sources. If Use‑Value is present, include the objective id / acceptanceSpec, counterfactual method (if predicted), and model edition per C.17. Note: `N`, `D`, `S`, and `I` are archive, tie-break, telemetry, or policy-promoted signals by default; only the declared `DominanceSet` enters the current front. `Use-Value` is decision-side/supporting unless the current Context explicitly declares it inside the active `Q` tuple / `DominanceSet`; when it is only recorded as a side measure, keep it outside dominance.

**Strategy (notation‑neutral).**

1. **Seeding.** Initialize with seeds (known solutions, random draws, or prior L0 artifacts).
2. **Iterated illumination.** Propose variations, evaluate **Q** (per‑component); maintain up to **K** elites per cell (or descriptor bucket); compute **N/D/S/I** on the fly; deduplicate by `DedupThreshold` in **CharacteristicSpace**.
3. **Budget‑bounded loop.** Iterate until budget or coverage‑convergence; return the **(ε‑)Pareto front** over the declared `DominanceSet`. When the Context consumes the ordinary default, that means the declared `Q` components under `DefaultId.DominanceRegime`, not one fresh local doctrine. Keep `N`, `D=ΔDiversity_P`, `Surprise`, and `IlluminationSummary` as archive/tie-break/telemetry signals unless one Context policy explicitly promotes one of them into dominance and records the policy id. `Use-Value` enters dominance only when the current Context explicitly declares it inside the active `Q` tuple; otherwise it may appear as one decision-side/supporting side note.
4. **Traceability.** Emit a **Design Rationale Record (DRR)**: grids/metrics versions, seed(s), policy and `TimeWindow`, which cells were filled, why items were dominated (list **Characteristics**), and how the final set was produced (including `ε`, `K`, and dedup). (Lightweight DRR is permitted per B.4 guidance.)
5. **Algorithmic freedom (informative).** Implementations MAY use MAP‑Elites/illumination, novelty search with local competition, Bayesian/surrogate‑assisted search, or deterministic enumerations; ε‑dominance or knee‑point thinning MAY be used *after* recording the full front in provenance.

> **No kernel growth.** This is a *Method* (C.4 Method‑CAL) plus a CHR import; **no new Γ‑operator** is added (per **A.11**).

### B.5.2.1:5 - Implementation & Binding into **B.5.2** (two injection points)

**Step 2 — Generate candidates.** 
**Precondition (USM+RSG).** Generation is permitted only when the **Claim/Work Scope** covers the TargetSlice (USM) **and** the performer’s **RoleAssignment** is in an **enactable RSG state** (Green-Gate law). 

When the pattern is imported, replace or *supplement* freeform brainstorming with **NQD‑Generate**; the output is a *pool* of L0 hypotheses annotated by `{N, D, Q, S, I, V?}` **plus provenance/DRR refs**. The abductive step remains *abduction* (a conjecture), now instrumented and diverse by construction.

**Step 3 — Plausibility filters.** Apply B.5.2’s plausibility criteria, now with explicit hooks:

* **Falsifiability** → filter out ideas with no testable predictions in the **Shaping/Evidence** states (B.5 alignment).
* **Explanatory power** → prioritize candidates whose *Q‑improvements* (and attached rationales) align with the framed anomaly.

The *selected* “prime hypothesis” proceeds exactly as in B.5.2: formalize it as a new `U.Episteme` at **L0**, then move to Deduction/Induction.

Primary dominance test: compute the (ε-)Pareto front over the declared `DominanceSet`. When the Context consumes the ordinary default, that means the declared `Q` components. By default, `N (Novelty@context)` and `ΔDiversity_P` act only as tie-breakers unless a policy explicitly promotes them into the dominance set; `S (Surprise)` and `I (Illumination)` are also tie-break/report-only by default; `Use-Value` remains non-dominant unless the active `Q` tuple explicitly includes it.

**Ordinary fallback posture when no narrower local policy is specified**  
> Do not mint one local dominance doctrine here. Consume the ordinary default `DefaultId.DominanceRegime` from `G.Core/G.5` together with the active `C.19` policy-side defaults; in ordinary Q-front use this means the declared `Q` components, with `ConstraintFit=pass` as **eligibility gate**.  
> **Tie‑breakers:** `Novelty@context`, `ΔDiversity_P`, and `Surprise`; `IlluminationSummary (telemetry summary over Diversity_P)` remains report‑only unless a CAL policy promotes it.  
> **Archive:** `K=1`, `ε=0`, deduplication in `CharacteristicSpace`.  
> **Policy family:** one uncertainty-aware explore policy family with one declared regime key; `UCB`-class with moderate temperature and `explore_share ≈ 0.3–0.5` is one didactic starter profile, not the semantic default family.  
> **Provenance (minimum):** record `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `TimeWindow`, `Seeds`.

“**Scope‑of‑claim annotation (descriptive).** Record the **BoundedContext** and **TimeWindow** that delimit where each **N/Q/D** measurement is intended to hold; this is for reasoning traceability only (no operational gates).”

Note — Status `Surprise` (scope and default role):
By default in B.5.2.1, `Surprise` functions solely as a secondary tie‑break among candidates that are otherwise Pareto‑equivalent on the Context’s primary characteristics. A Context policy MAY elevate `Surprise` into the dominance set, allowing it to enter the CreativitySpace dominance alongside the primary characteristics.  If no Context policy is specified, the default tie‑break role applies.

### B.5.2.1:5.1 - Creative-generation consistency with the declared dominance doctrine

- When candidate generation speaks about fronts, use the declared `DominanceSet` for the front and keep archive retention separate when archive mode is active.
- Do not write novelty or diversity terms into the front definition merely because they are important to archive quality or exploration value.
- If one generator emits both a front-facing result and an archive-facing result, say which surface each result belongs to.
- If one generator speaks about selected results, keep that language in the shortlist family rather than silently reusing front language.
- Prefer wording like `front over the declared DominanceSet, plus the corresponding ExplorationArchive when archive mode is active` over wording that folds `Q`, novelty, and diversity into one default front by habit.
- The local generation story should stay consistent with the declared `Front`, `Archive`, and `Shortlist` language so comparison stays intelligible and lawful.

### B.5.2.1:6 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑B.5.2.1‑1 (CHR discipline).** If a Context uses this pattern, it **SHALL** declare the Creativity‑CHR **Characteristics** with **A.18**‑style templates (type, unit/range, polarity). No new kernel terms are introduced.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑2 (Instrumented generation).** Step 2 of **B.5.2** **SHALL** either (a) invoke *NQD‑Generate* or (b) justify a Context‑specific generator of equivalent effect (diversity + quality + novelty with measurable **Characteristics**).
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑3 (Diversity coupling).** When this pattern is used, **D MUST be ΔDiversity_P** computed against the current candidate Pool using the **C.17** definition of **Diversity_P** under the same Context, CharacteristicSpace, kernel, and TimeWindow.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑Eligibility**: Eligibility requires **(i)** `ConstraintFit = pass` for the candidate (Norm‑CAL must‑set), **then (ii)** **USM** coverage for the TargetSlice and **(iii)** an enactable **RSG** state for the performer; only then may calls to `Γ_nqd.*` occur.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑4 (Non‑dominated candidate front).** The *CandidateSet* **MUST** include the **Pareto front** over the declared `DominanceSet`. If the Context consumes the ordinary default, cite that consumed `DefaultId.DominanceRegime` rather than restating one local default doctrine. Any pruned candidate **MUST** carry a DRR note (“dominated by … on {Characteristics}”). `N`, `D=ΔDiversity_P`, `Surprise`, `IlluminationSummary`, and similar signals enter dominance only under an explicit recorded promotion policy; otherwise they remain archive, tie-break, or telemetry signals.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑4a (Archive companion when retained exploration is in scope).** If the active policy depends on retained exploration, stepping-stone retention, or open-ended search, the emitted candidate package **MUST** include the corresponding `ExplorationArchive` or cite one explicit policy id that says archive mode is disabled for that run.
**CC‑B5.2.1‑5 (Abductive primacy preserved).** The pattern **MUST NOT** bypass the ADI ordering mandated by **B.5**: induction may not start before deduction; abductive L0 creation remains the start.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑6 (Normalization for Pareto).** When **Q** has multiple components with different units/scales, Contexts **SHALL** normalize or use declared utility‑free monotone transforms before dominance tests.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑7 (Use‑Value separation). ** If Use‑Value (C.17 §5.2) is recorded outside the active `DominanceSet`, it SHALL remain outside Assurance scores and MAY inform decision lenses (Decsn‑CAL). If the current Context explicitly places `Use-Value` inside the active `Q` tuple, record that declaration together with its objective id / acceptanceSpec. Do not alter **R/G** semantics based on side-measure Use‑Value. (see **C.17 §5.2** for `Use-Value / ValueGain` definition)
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑8 (Provenance).** Each `h_i` in the *CandidateSet* **MUST** reference its `provenance_i` sufficient to reproduce scores given the same `Policy(TimeWindow)`, score/metric versions, and `DeterminismSeed?`.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑9 (Secondary metrics).** **I (illumination)** and **S (surprise)** SHALL be used only for tie‑breaking/reporting unless explicitly promoted by policy; the **primary dominance test uses the declared `DominanceSet`**, which under the ordinary default means the context-declared `Q` components.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑10 (Cell capacity & ε).** If `K>1` or `ε>0` are used, the values MUST be declared and recorded in provenance; any thinning AFTER recording the front SHALL be documented in the DRR.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑11 (Dominance set).** If the Context consumes the ordinary default `DefaultId.DominanceRegime`, the active dominance set **SHALL be the declared `Q` components** and provenance **SHALL** cite that consumed default plus the active `C.19` policy or lens id. **N (Novelty@context)** and **ΔDiversity_P** act as **tie‑breakers** unless explicitly promoted by **policy** (record the policy‑id in provenance).

### B.5.2.1:7 - Cognitive Load & Kernel Growth Budget

**For engineers/managers (user cognitive load).**

* *Added steps:* selecting descriptor **Characteristics** & granularity; reading a Pareto table (**non‑statisticians tip:** scan the “front” row; ignore dominated rows).
* *Mitigations:* provide a one‑screen “NQD Cards” template analogous to RSG cards; default grids and metrics per Context. (Keep ≤ 7 visible **Characteristics**—mirrors RSG human‑scale guidance.)
* *Reader quickstart (engineer‑manager):* (1) Pick 2–3 **Q** characteristics aligned to the anomaly + a simple **CharacteristicSpace** (2–4 dimensions). (2) Accept defaults for `NoveltyMetric`, grid granularity, and `K=1`. (3) Run **NQD‑Generate** to a fixed budget; read the *front row* first. (4) Apply Step 3 filters; log decisions in the DRR.

**For the framework (kernel growth).**

* *Zero* new primitives; only a CHR import and a **Method**. Passes **A.11** minimal‑sufficiency. 

### B.5.2.1:8 - Placement in the Reasoning Cycle (ADI)

This pattern **only structures hypothesis exploration** (Abduction) and does not define or imply any **operational** gates. It respects ADI ordering (Abduct → Deduct → Induct) and leaves deployment/readiness concerns to patterns outside this spec.

### B.5.2.1:9 - Context‑Level KPIs (optional, informative)

Contexts *may* monitor these—*not* as gates, but to improve practice:

1. **Generativity (Gv).** Fraction of abductive cycles whose selected candidate reaches **L1/L2** within policy windows (time‑to‑L1; time‑to‑evidence). (Maps onto state transitions driven by **B.5**.)
2. **Frontier‑Hit Rate (FHR).** % of cycles where the chosen candidate lies on the **Pareto front** over the declared `DominanceSet` at selection time; track novelty/diversity contribution separately as archive, tie-break, or policy-promoted evidence.
3. Coverage Gain (ΔI, report). Change in the *illumination summary* (coverage map/%filled cells) per cycle (how much of the descriptor space is now “lit”).
4. **Exploration Cost Ratio (ECR).** Compute/time spent in NQD‑Generate divided by downstream Shape/Evidence cost saved (tracks whether the pattern pays for itself).
5. **Refutation Learning Yield (RLY).** Among *refuted* candidates, % that added new coverage or raised SurpriseScore—turning “failures” into map‑building.

### B.5.2.1:10 - Worked micro‑example (abbreviated)

**Framing = Step 1 in B.5.2**
**Context:** A Context using FPF to evolve FPF itself (meta‑improvement). *Anomaly:* “Users perceive FPF as compliance‑heavy; we need first‑principles creativity surfaced.” 

**Step 2 (NQD‑Generate).**

* **CharacteristicSpace:** {*creative‑characteristic count*, *explicit novelty metric present?*, *QD operator present?*, *didactic cards present?*}. *(Illustrative; Contexts SHALL define their own descriptors per §2.)*
* **Q‑measures:** {*editor effort↓*, *time‑to‑L1↓*, *reader clarity↑*}.
* **Output Pareto set (sketch):**

  * `h₁ = “Add Creativity‑CHR + NQD pattern (this pattern)”` — high *D*, high *N*, medium *Q*.
  * `h₂ = “Rename governance terms to arts vocabulary”` — low *N*, low *D*, medium *Q*.
  * `h₃ = “Add live ideation sandbox (ops tooling)”` — medium *N*, medium *D*, high *Q*.

**Step 3 (Filters).**

* **Falsifiability:** `h₂` weak—no testable prediction → drop.
* **Scope (USM):** `h₁` scoped to Part B; `TimeWindow = edition 2025‑Q4` → *covers TargetSlice*. `h₃` crosses Contexts (tooling) → requires Bridge; the overhead is accounted for in **R** (not **F/G**). *(This pattern does not create or alter Bridges.)*
* **Select prime:** `h₁` → formalize as L0 episteme (this pattern), move to *Shaping* (define checklist), then *Evidence* (track KPIs).

### B.5.2.1:10a - Trade‑offs & mitigations

* **Cognitive effort.** Interpreting Pareto sets and coverage maps adds thinking overhead. *Mitigation:* standard “NQD Card” + default grids; keep **Characteristics** small in number (≤ 7). *Manager shortcut:* pick 2–3 **Q** characteristics that reflect the anomaly, then run with defaults.
* **Locality.** Novelty/diversity are **context‑local**; Cross‑context reuse requires **re‑measurement or an explicit mapping**. This pattern **does not define** Cross‑context operational controls.
* **Not a magic idea machine.** Abduction remains human/agentic; the pattern *structures* search, it does not automate insight. B.5’s abductive primacy stands.
* **Metric gaming & collinearity.** Avoid making **N** and **S** redundant by policy; when strong collinearity is detected, freeze one as informative only and record rationale in the DRR.

### B.5.2.1:11 - Related Patterns

* **Extends:** **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** (Step 2/3 operationalization). 
* **Driven by / feeds:** **B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle** (Abduction→Deduction→Induction), **B.4 Evolution Loop** (Observe/Refine). 
* **Uses:** **A.17/A.18** for characteristic discipline and **B.5 ADI ordering**. **May** refer to Context‑specific MAP‑Elites/novelty‑search implementations in the MethodDescription. **No operational gating is in scope here.** C.17 (Use‑Value / ValueGain, normative definition).
* **Respects:** **A.11** (no kernel growth beyond CHR template import + Method).
