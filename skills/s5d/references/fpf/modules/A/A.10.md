## A.10 - Evidence Graph Referring (C‑4)

*“A claim without a chain is only an opinion.”*

### A.10:1 - Context

FPF is a holonic framework: wholes are built from parts (A.1, A.14), and reasoning travels across scales via Γ‑flavours (B.1). To keep this reasoning honest and reproducible, every **published assertion** must be *anchored* in concrete **symbol carriers** and **well‑typed transformations** performed by an **external TransformerRole** (A.12, A.15). **Publication** itself is the typed projection **I→D→S** (`Publ_ID`, `Formalize_DS`) per A.7 and is **not execution**; any physical/digital release, rendering, or upload is **Work** by an external transformer **on carriers**, cited in SCR.

Managers can read this as a simple rule of thumb:
> **Claim → (Proof or Test) → Confidence badge**
> …where the proof/test is traceable to real carriers and to an external system/Transformer who executed an agreed method.

This pattern defines the **Evidence Graph Referring Standard** common to all Γ‑flavours (Γ\_sys — formerly Γ\_core, Γ\_epist, Γ\_method, Γ\_time, Γ\_work) and clarifies:
(a) the difference between **mereology** (part‑whole; builds holarchies) and **provenance** (why a claim is admissible; does *not* build holarchies);
(b) the run‑time / design‑time separation (A.4) across **Role–Method–Work** (A.15).

Use this when a model, report, metric, confidence badge, review note, or QL reading is starting to act like evidence but the carrier, transformer, method, time stance, or provenance edge is still implicit. The action is to turn the assertion into a small because-graph: name the claim, name the carriers, name the external transformer role, name the method or work trace, state the time/coverage condition, and attach the resulting evidence edge to the claim rather than to the holon itself.

Useful output: a claim that can answer "because of which carriers, by which transformer, using which method, and when?" without making provenance pretend to be part-whole structure.


### A.10:2 - Problem

Without a uniform anchor, models drift into five failure modes:

1. **Weightless claims.** Metrics or arguments appear in the model with no link to their **symbol carriers** (files, datasets, lab notebooks, figures).
2. **Collapsed scopes.** Design‑time method specs are silently mixed with run‑time traces; results cannot be reproduced because “what was planned” and “what actually ran” are conflated.
3. **Self‑justifying loops.** A holon attempts to evidence itself (violates A.12 externality), producing cyclic provenance and unverifiable conclusions.
4. **Source loss during aggregation.** As Γ combines parts, some sources “fall out”; later audit cannot reconstruct why a compound claim was accepted.
5. **Temporal ambiguity.** Time‑series are aggregated without interval coverage or dating source; gaps/overlaps invalidate comparisons and trend claims.

The business effect is predictable: confidence badges cannot be defended, cross‑scale consistency (A.9) is broken, and iteration slows because every review re‑litigates “where did this come from?”.


### A.10:3 - Forces

| Force                           | Tension                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. burden**     | One Standard must fit systems and epistemes ↔ Authors should not drown in paperwork.                                                              |
| **Externality vs. reflexivity** | Evidence must be produced by an external TransformerRole (A.12) ↔ Some systems adapt themselves (need reflexive modelling without self‑evidence). |
| **Atemporal vs. temporal**      | Many claims are state‑like ↔ Many others are histories; evidence must respect order and coverage (Γ\_time).                                       |
| **Rigor vs. flow**              | Formal proofs and controlled tests raise confidence ↔ Engineering cadence needs lightweight, incremental anchors.                                 |
| **Mereology vs. provenance**    | Part‑whole edges build holarchies ↔ Evidence edges never do; the two graphs must interlock without leaking semantics.                             |


### A.10:4 - Solution — The Evidence Graph Referring Standard

The Standard is a small set of primitives applied uniformly, with **manager‑first clarity** and **formal hooks** for proof obligations.

#### A.10:4.1 - EPV‑DAG (Evidence–Provenance DAG).
A **typed, acyclic** graph disjoint from mereology. Node types: **SymbolCarrier** (a `s.System` in **CarrierRole**, A.15), **TransformerRole** (external Transformer, A.12), **MethodDescription** (design‑time blueprint of a method, A.15), **Observation** (a dated assertion/result), **s.Episteme** (knowledge holon). Edge vocabulary is small and normative: `evidences`, `derivedFrom`, `measuredBy`, `interpretedBy`, `usedCarrier`, `happenedBefore` (temporal), etc.
*Manager view:* it is the *“because‑graph”*: every claim answers “because of these carriers, by this Transformer, using that method, then.”

#### A.10:4.2 - Anchors (two relations, two flavours).**

* `verifiedBy` — links a claim to **formal** evidence (proof obligations, static guarantees, model‑checking artefacts).
* `validatedBy` — links a claim to **empirical** evidence (tests, measurements, trials, observations).
  Both anchors terminate in the EPV‑DAG, not in the mereology graph.

#### A.10:4.3 SCR / RSCR (Symbol Carrier Registers).
Every `Γ_epist` aggregation **SHALL** emit an **SCR**: an exhaustive register of **symbol carriers** materially used in the aggregate, with id, type, version/date, checksum, source/conditions and optional `PortionOf` (A.14) for sub‑carriers.
Every `Γ_epist^compile` **SHALL** emit an **RSCR**: SCR specialised to a **bounded context** (vocabularies, units) with publication‑grade identifiers and hashes.
*Why this matters:* it prevents “lost sources” during composition and underwrites reproducibility without mandating any specific tool.

#### A.10:4.4 Scope alignment (A.4) across Role–Method–Work (A.15).

* **Design‑time**: **MethodDescription** lives here; methods are blueprints; anchors reference what *would* constitute proof or test.
* **Run‑time**: **Work** (actual execution) lives here; traces reference which MethodDescription they instantiate and record `happenedBefore`.
  Bridging edges are explicit (“this run trace instantiates that spec”), so scopes never silently mix.

#### A.10:4.5 External TransformerRole (A.12).
The system that produces or interprets evidence is **external** to the holon under evaluation. If true reflexivity is essential, model a **meta‑holon** (A.12): the self‑updating holon becomes the *object* of a higher‑level external transformer (the “mirror”), restoring objectivity.

#### A.10:4.6 Γ‑flavour hooks (how each flavour anchors).

* **Γ\_sys (formerly Γ\_core)**: physical properties are anchored by measurement models, boundary conditions, calibration carriers, and dated observations.
* **Γ\_epist**: always outputs SCR/RSCR; every provenance/evidence node resolves to an SCR/RSCR entry.
* **Γ\_method**: order‑sensitive composition; at design‑time a **Method Instantiation Card (MIC)** states `Precedes/Choice/Join` and guards; at run‑time traces record `happenedBefore` and point to the MethodDescription they instantiate.
* **Γ\_time**: temporal claims state interval coverage; **Monotone Coverage** (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) is required.
* **Γ\_work**: resource spending and yield are evidenced by instrumented carriers (meters, logs) and their MethodDescriptions; keep **resource rosters** separate from SCR/RSCR.

> **Manager’s shortcut:** If you can answer *what carriers, which system, which method, when*, the anchor is likely sufficient; if any of the four is missing, it is not.

### A.10:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID                                      | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Purpose (what it prevents)                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A10.1 (EPV‑DAG Presence)**         | Every published claim MUST have a path in the Evidence–Provenance DAG (EPV‑DAG) to concrete **SymbolCarrier** nodes and to the **external** `TransformerRole` that produced or interpreted the evidence.                                | Stops “weightless claims” and self‑justifying text.        |
| **CC‑A10.2 (SCR)**                      | Any `Γ_epist^synth` operation SHALL output an **SCR** listing all symbol carriers materially used in the aggregate `s.Episteme`.                                                                                                        | Prevents source loss during aggregation.                   |
| **CC‑A10.3 (RSCR)**                     | Any `Γ_epist^compile` operation SHALL output an **RSCR** adapted to the target bounded context (vocabularies, units) with publication‑grade identifiers/hashes; SCR→RSCR MUST preserve carrier identity/integrity.                      | Keeps releases auditable and context‑consistent.           |
| **CC‑A10.4 (Resolution)**               | Every provenance/evidence node in the dependency graph MUST be resolvable to an SCR/RSCR entry. Unresolved links invalidate the claim.                                                                                                  | Eliminates dangling references and unverifiable citations. |
| **CC‑A10.5 (Scope Separation)**         | A single EPV‑DAG instance SHALL NOT mix design‑time MethodDescription nodes with run‑time Work traces. Bridges (“this run trace instantiates that spec”) MUST be explicit.                                                                     | Avoids conflating intent and execution.                    |
| **CC‑A10.6 (Externality)**              | The evidencing `TransformerRole` MUST be **external** to the holon under evaluation (A.12). Reflexive cases require modelling a meta‑holon and an external mirror.                                                                      | Prevents self‑creation/self‑evidence paradoxes.            |
| **CC‑A10.7 (Temporal Coverage)**        | For `Γ\_time` claims, interval coverage MUST be monotone and fully specified; gaps/overlaps require explicit justification or rejection.                                                                                                 | Stops invalid time‑series aggregation.                     |
| **CC‑A10.8 (Integrity & Immutability)** | SCR/RSCR entries MUST include version/date and checksums; published SCR/RSCR are immutable—updates create a new revision id with a pointer to the prior one.                                                                            | Guards against silent drift and tampering.                 |
| **CC‑A10.9 (Holarchy Firewall)**        | EPV‑DAG MUST use provenance edges only; mereological edges (`ComponentOf`, `MemberOf`, `PortionOf`, `PhaseOf`, etc.) MUST NOT appear in EPV‑DAG; conversely, provenance edges MUST NOT be used to build holarchies.                     | Keeps part‑whole and evidence semantics disjoint.          |
| **CC‑A10.10 (Γ\_sys Anchors)**          | Physical claims aggregated by `Γ_sys` MUST reference measurement models (quantity, unit, uncertainty), boundary conditions, and calibration carriers.                                                                                   | Ensures physical plausibility and comparability.           |
| **CC‑A10.11 (Γ\_method Anchors)**       | For order‑sensitive composition, design‑time MUST include a **Method Instantiation Card (MIC)** (Precedes/Choice/Join, guards, exceptions); run‑time traces MUST record `happenedBefore` and reference the MethodDescription they instantiate. | Preserves order semantics and reproducibility.             |
| **CC‑A10.12 (Γ\_work Anchors)**         | Resource spending/yield claims MUST be evidenced by instrumented carriers (meters, logs) and their MethodDescriptions; resource **rosters** MUST NOT be conflated with SCR/RSCR.                                                               | Distinguishes cost accounting from knowledge carriers.     |

**Manager’s audit (non‑normative, quick):** For any claim, ask **What carriers? Which system? Which method? When?** If any answer is missing, A.10 is not satisfied.


### A.10:7 - Consequences

| Benefit                           | Why it matters                                                                  | Trade‑off / Mitigation                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cross‑scale reproducibility**   | Any composite metric or argument can be walked back to its carriers and method. | **Overhead** of maintaining SCR/RSCR. *Mitigation:* keep entries minimal but complete; use checklists from the pedagogical companion. |
| **Design/run clarity**            | Intent (MethodDescription) is cleanly separated from execution (Work traces).          | **Discipline** needed at boundaries. *Mitigation:* MIC templates; explicit “instantiates” bridges.                                    |
| **Objective evidence**            | External `TransformerRole` eliminates self‑evidence loops.                      | **Reflexive systems** require a mirror meta‑holon. *Mitigation:* provide a “reflexive modelling” appendix with examples.              |
| **Comparable numbers over time**  | Temporal coverage invariants prevent “trend” claims built on gaps.              | **Extra dating work** for legacy data. *Mitigation:* allow provisional labels until dating is completed.                              |
| **Safe composition of knowledge** | SCR/RSCR keep sources intact as Γ\_epist composes epistemes.                    | **Initial friction** in teams new to carrier thinking. *Mitigation:* start with “top‑10 carriers per claim” rule, expand as needed.   |
| **Feeds Trust Calculus (B.3)**    | Anchors provide the inputs (R, CL, etc.) needed to score confidence.            | —                                                                                                                                     |


### A.10:8 - Rationale (SoTA alignment, reader‑friendly)

* **Metrology & assurance.** The requirement to name quantities, units, uncertainty, calibration carriers reflects long‑standing metrology practice and modern assurance cases: numbers are only comparable when their **measurement models** are stated.
* **Knowledge provenance.** The EPV‑DAG and SCR/RSCR embody post‑2015 best practices in provenance for knowledge artefacts: keep a complete, machine‑checkable trail from claims to carriers; separate provenance from part‑whole.
* **Temporal reasoning.** Monotone coverage (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) aligns with temporal knowledge graph practice and avoids “impossible histories.”
* **Holonic parsimony.** By drawing a firewall between **mereology** (A.14) and **provenance**, A.10 prevents semantic leakage and keeps the holarchy well‑typed.
* **Role–Method–Work clarity.** Anchoring explicitly rides on A.15: **roles** act via **methods** specified at design‑time and produce **work** observed at run‑time. This keeps agency, policy, and execution disentangled yet connected.


### A.10:9 - Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1 Holonic Foundation; A.4 Temporal Duality; **A.12 Transformer Externalization**; **A.14 Advanced Mereology**; **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment**.
* **Constrains / ssed by:** B.1 (all Γ‑flavours: `Γ_sys`, `Γ_epist`, `Γ_method`, `Γ\_time`, `Γ_work`); B.1.1 (Dependency Graph & Proofs).
* **Enables:** **B.3 Trust Calculus** (R/CL inputs, auditability); B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop (clean design/run bridges).

### A.10:10 - Migration (practical and brief)

Apply these text edits:

1. **Terminology**

   * `manifest` → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**; `release manifest` → **“Release SCR (RSCR)”**.
   * `creator` / `observer` (as internal evidencer) → **`TransformerRole (external)`**.
   * “symbol register” (ambiguous) → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**.
   * Keep **resource rosters** in `Γ_work` separate from SCR/RSCR.

3. **Boilerplate inserts**

   * In **A.10** (this pattern): retain definitions of **EPV‑DAG**, **SCR/RSCR**, and the flavour‑specific anchors.
   * In **B.1.3 (`Γ_epist`)**: add the **Obligations — SCR/RSCR** block (“`Γ_epist^synth` SHALL output SCR… `Γ_epist^compile` SHALL output RSCR…”).
   * In **B.1.5 (`Γ_method`)**: ensure **MIC** is referenced (Precedes/Choice/Join, guards, exceptions) and run‑time traces reference the **MethodDescription** they instantiate.
   * In **B.1.6 (`Γ_work`)**: say “resource rosters are not SCR/RSCR; anchor meter/log readings via EPV‑DAG.”

### A.10:10a - Evidence carriers for quantum-like readings

Use A.10 when a quantum-like statement needs evidence rather than only a local modeling note. The practical question is not "is this quantum-like source impressive?" but "which carrier supports which weak claim, under which time window and method?"

Action path:

1. State the weakest state/probe/export/viability reading being supported.
2. Pin the concrete carriers: source, trace, dashboard export, report, observation, metric, work result, model output, interview, survey, or incident record.
3. State the evidence-producing role and method: who or what produced the carrier, by which method, probe, measurement, or work act.
4. State the time window and decay/reopen condition.
5. State what the carrier does not show, including the strongest rival explanation still live.
6. Choose the next pattern: stay in A.10 for carrier anchoring, route to `B.3` for assurance strength, route to `C.16` for measurement legality, route to `F.9` for bridge/export loss, or route to a `C.26.*` pattern for the remaining probe/state/envelope burden.

For probe-coupled, distributed-state, bridge-loss, measurement-frame, or viability-envelope readings, include at least:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Claim | The weakest state/probe/export/viability reading being supported |
| Carrier | The concrete evidence carrier or carrier class |
| Source role | Source, witness, measurement, report, trace, dashboard, work product, or human statement |
| Method / probe | The measurement, work act, survey, dashboard query, API read, workshop, model, or trace query that produced the carrier |
| Time window | When the evidence was produced and how long it remains fit for the intended inference |
| Confidence / limits | What the carrier does not show, and what rival explanation remains plausible |
| Reopen trigger | When stronger decision, assurance, audit, or action use requires more evidence |

Useful outputs:

- a local evidence note when the claim only guides discussion;
- an EPV-DAG / SCR / RSCR entry when the claim enters a published assertion;
- a B.3 assurance tuple when the claim will support readiness, audit, release, compliance, or comparative strength;
- a reroute note when the carrier shows only ordinary measurement, bridge loss, or work enactment.

Do not let the label `quantum-like` carry evidence weight by itself. The evidence graph carries the claim; the math lens only explains what representational mistake the evidence is being used to avoid.

### A.10:End
