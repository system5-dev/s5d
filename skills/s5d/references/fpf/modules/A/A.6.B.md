## A.6.B — Boundary Norm Square (Laws / Admissibility / Deontics / Work‑Effects)



> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> **Placement:** Part A → A.6.B (matrix module; referenced by A.6 cluster overview)
> **Builds on:** E.8 (authoring template), A.6.0 (`U.Signature`), A.6.1 (`U.Mechanism`), A.6.3 (`U.EpistemicViewing`), E.17.0/E.17 (MVPK + “no new semantics” faces), A.7 (Object≠Description≠Carrier), F.18 (promise/utterance/commitment), E.10.D2 (I/D/S vs Surface), E.10/L‑SURF (Surface token discipline)
> **Purpose (one line):** Provide a canonical 2×2 norm square that classifies boundary statements (L/A/D/E), constrains how each quadrant is written, and defines explicit cross‑quadrant reference rules so boundaries remain evolvable and audit‑ready.

### A.6.B:0 — Conventions

**Keywords.** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **MAY**, and **SHALL** are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119/8174. Lower‑case “must/may/should” in explanatory prose is descriptive, not normative.

**Quadrant labels.** This pattern uses the routing labels **L / A / D / E** as *statement quadrants*:

* **L** — Laws & Definitions
* **A** — Admissibility & Gates
* **D** — Deontics & Commitments
* **E** — Work‑Effects & Evidence

These labels are **routing labels for statements**, not MVPK face kinds and not pattern identifiers.

**Statement identifiers (recommended).** Routable statements **SHOULD** be given stable IDs with a quadrant prefix: `L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, `E-*`. Other sections and views **SHOULD** reference these IDs rather than restating the same constraint in new words.

**Non-collision note (informative).** The `A-*` prefix here is “Admissibility”, not Part‑A numbering and not MVPK’s `AssuranceLane` face kind. If this is a readability hazard in your program, prefer an explicit `G-*` (“Gate”) local convention while keeping the quadrant name “Admissibility”. Also avoid introducing single‑letter mnemonics for MVPK face kinds inside this cluster (MVPK has a legacy L,P,D,E mnemonic); spell face kinds in full to reduce collisions.

**Atomic claim.** An **atomic claim** is a sentence (or bullet) that performs exactly one logical role and is routable to exactly one quadrant. If a sentence mixes roles, it is **not atomic** and **MUST** be split before it can be routed.

**Adjudication substrate (for routing).** For the purposes of this square, an atomic claim is classified by the primary substrate that decides its satisfaction:

* **In‑description / in‑theory**: satisfaction is decided from the description alone (e.g., proof/type validation), or the claim is itself a governance utterance whose content is fully determined by the text.
* **In‑work / in‑execution**: deciding satisfaction requires observing executed work and/or inspecting carriers produced in work.

**Note (important).** `D-*` claims are authored and interpreted in the description; whether they are met is typically established indirectly via referenced `E-*` claims (or other governance procedures). This does not move `D-*` into quadrant E; it clarifies the routing axis.

**Modality family.** A claim is either:

* **Truth‑conditional**: definitions, invariants, typing rules (“is”, “iff”, “∀”).
* **Governance**: governance conditions, obligations, commitments, and exclusions (“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”, “is admissible”, “is blocked”, “commits to”).

### A.6.B:1 — Problem frame

Boundary descriptions routinely collapse four distinct claim families into “contract soup”: definitions are written as obligations, runtime gates are hidden inside laws, governance talk is assigned to “the interface”, and “guarantees” are asserted without any evidence story. The resulting boundary is brittle: substitution becomes unclear, and auditability becomes performative rather than adjudicable.

FPF already separates the necessary strata (Signature vs Mechanism, Object≠Description≠Carrier, views under viewpoints). What is still needed is a **single, reusable routing primitive** that any boundary text can apply consistently and that other patterns can cite as a stable authoring module.

### A.6.B:2 — Problem

When authors cannot reliably answer two questions—

1. “Is this a truth‑conditional statement or a governance statement?”
2. “Is it adjudicated by reading the description or by observing work?”

—then boundary statements drift across layers, faces fork semantics, and “compliance” becomes a matter of interpretation rather than a property that can be checked.

A boundary needs a minimal, stable classification that:

* routes every **atomic** statement to a unique quadrant, and
* forces any cross‑quadrant dependencies to be **explicitly referenced**, not smuggled by paraphrase.

### A.6.B:3 — Forces

| Force                              | Tension                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision vs readability**       | Predicate‑style constraints reduce ambiguity; narrative helps adoption.                        |
| **Evolvability vs enforceability** | Stable laws should not embed volatile runtime gates; governance still needs enforcement hooks. |
| **Auditability vs simplicity**     | Evidence makes claims adjudicable; evidence also introduces operational design obligations.    |
| **Local meaning vs reuse**         | Boundaries must be local; reuse must be explicit via IDs and references, not duplicated prose. |

### A.6.B:4 - Solution — the Boundary Norm Square

#### A.6.B:4.1 - Two independent distinctions

The **Boundary Norm Square** is the cross product of two independent distinctions:

1. **Modality family:** Truth‑conditional vs Governance
2. **Adjudication locus:** In‑description vs In‑work

The square yields four quadrants that are *mutually exclusive for atomic claims*.

#### A.6.B:4.2 — The square

|                                | **Truth‑conditional** (definitions & invariants) | **Governance** (governance conditions & obligations) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **In‑description / in‑theory** | **L — Laws & Definitions**                       | **D — Deontics & Commitments**             |
| **In‑work / in‑execution**     | **E — Work‑Effects & Evidence**                  | **A — Admissibility & Gates**              |

**Clarification (do not conflate).** The Governance column includes two different “normative” roles:
* **D** is **agent/role governance** (duties, commitments, prohibitions).
* **A** is **mechanism governance** (admissibility predicates: what the mechanism admits at application time).
`A-*` is not an obligation on an actor; obligations belong in `D-*` and may reference `A-*`.

**Normative rule (single quadrant).** Each **atomic** claim **MUST** be routable to exactly one quadrant **L/A/D/E**.

**Normative rule (no mixed sentences).** A conforming boundary text **SHALL** decompose any sentence that bundles multiple quadrants (typical form: “MUST … if … then … and it is logged …”) into multiple atomic claims before those claims are treated as normative.

#### A.6.B:4.3 — Canonical homes in the Signature Stack

The quadrants have canonical “homes” in the boundary stack:

* **L → Signature layer:** `U.Signature.Laws` (and mechanism‑local semantic laws if present).
* **A → Mechanism layer:** `U.Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions` (entry gates / runtime admissibility predicates).
* **D → Norms & commitments layer:** role‑anchored duties, commitments, publication/accountability duties (often rendered inside MVPK `TechCard`).
* **E → Evidence bindings layer:** work‑adjudicated effects tied to carriers and measurement conditions (authored canonically in an Evidence/Carriers section; commonly rendered inside MVPK `AssuranceLane` as a projection).

A published view **MUST NOT** introduce new semantic claims outside this routed claim set. **E.17 (MVPK)** is a specialization that enforces this rule for a fixed set of publication face kinds.

### A.6.B:5 — Quadrant specifications

This section is the normative “API” of the square: what each quadrant is for, how it is written, and what it must not contain.

#### A.6.B:5.1 — Quadrant L: Laws & Definitions

**Intent.** State truth‑conditional content: definitions, invariants, typing/well‑formedness constraints, equational laws.

**Adjudication.** In‑description: can be checked by inspection, proof, type validation, or model reasoning.

**Canonical form.** `Definition:` / `Invariant:` / predicate‑style constraints using “is / iff / for all”.

**Prohibitions.**

* An `L-*` statement **MUST NOT** contain RFC deontic keywords (**MUST/SHALL/SHOULD/MAY**) as operators inside the law/definition itself.
* An `L-*` statement **MUST NOT** encode runtime gate predicates (those are `A-*`).
* An `L-*` statement **MUST NOT** assert evidence availability or measurement outcomes (those are `E-*`).

**A.7 anchoring.** `L-*` claims are **Descriptions**: they specify semantics of the signature/mechanism description, not work.

**Typical dependence.** `A-*` and `E-*` claims may reference `L-*` IDs for vocabulary, metric definitions, and invariants needed for interpretation.

#### A.6.B:5.2 — Quadrant A: Admissibility & Gates

**Intent.** Specify when a mechanism application is admissible: runtime entry predicates, authorization gates, validity gates, applicability checks that require context or execution environment.

**Common mistake #0 — Applicability ≠ Admissibility (informative).** Signature `Applicability` scopes *intended use/bounded context*; it is not a runtime entry gate. Runtime entry checks and admissibility predicates belong in `U.Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions` as `A-*`. If your prose reads like “clients must satisfy the applicability”, you almost certainly want a `D-*` duty + an `A-*` gate (linked by ID) instead.

**Adjudication.** In‑work: evaluated at mechanism entry (or operationally at the point the mechanism is applied).

**Canonical form.** Predicate style, e.g.:

* “A request is admissible iff …”
* `admissible(x) iff P(x)` (conceptual form; no particular syntax is required)

**Prohibitions.**

* An `A-*` statement **MUST NOT** be placed in `U.Signature.Laws`.
* An `A-*` statement **MUST NOT** use RFC deontic keywords as if it were an agent obligation. (It is a gate predicate, not a duty.)
* An `A-*` statement **MUST NOT** claim that evidence exists (that is `E-*`) or that someone must enforce the gate (that is `D-*`).

**A.7 anchoring.** `A-*` claims are **Descriptions** of a mechanism gate. They are not “what a client must do”; they are “what the mechanism admits”.

**Required references (explicit).** If an `A-*` predicate relies on defined terms or invariants, it **SHOULD** reference the relevant `L-*` IDs (or at minimum the signature that defines them).

#### A.6.B:5.3 — Quadrant D: Deontics & Commitments

**Intent.** State governance: obligations, governance conditions, exclusions, commitments, publication duties, operational duties, contractual commitments—always with accountable agents/roles.

**Adjudication.** In‑description (governance is stated in the spec); compliance may be audited via `E-*`.

**Canonical form.** A deontic statement **MUST** have an accountable subject (agent/role), e.g.:

* “Client implementers **MUST** satisfy `A-…`.”
* “Operators **SHALL** retain carriers …”
* “Provider **SHALL** meet `E-…` under exclusions …”

**Canonical payload (recommended; lintable).** When a `D-*` claim is intended to be lintable/reusable, it **SHOULD** be representable as a `U.Commitment` record (A.2.8). Default fields to make explicit:

* `id` (often the `D-*` claim ID),
* `subject` (accountable role/party; never an episteme),
* `modality` (BCP‑14/RFC keyword family normalized),
* `scope` + `validityWindow`,
* `referents` (by ID; e.g., `SVC-*`, `L-*`, `A-*`, `E-*`, `MethodDescriptionRef(...)`),
* optional `adjudication.evidenceRefs` when the commitment is meant to be auditable,
* optional `source` when authority/provenance matters.

**Prohibitions.**

* A `D-*` statement **MUST NOT** use “the system/service/interface/spec” as the grammatical subject unless the accountable role/party is explicitly named (so the statement is representable as a `U.Commitment` with an explicit `subject`, A.2.8). (**F.18** is a lexical anchor only.)
* A `D-*` statement **MUST NOT** restate `L-*` or `A-*` predicates in new words when an ID exists; it **SHOULD** reference the ID.
* A `D-*` statement **MUST NOT** pretend that commitments are laws. A commitment is an agent relation, not a truth‑conditional invariant.

**A.7 anchoring.** `D-*` claims are primarily **about Objects** (roles/agents and their duties) or **about Carriers** (retention/exposure duties), but they are still written as **Descriptions**.

**Required references (explicit).**

* If a `D-*` statement imposes compliance with a gate, it **MUST** reference the relevant `A-*` ID(s).
* If a `D-*` statement is meant to be auditable, it **SHOULD** reference the `E-*` claim(s) that provide evidence and the carrier classes involved.
#### A.6.B:5.4 — Quadrant E: Work‑Effects & Evidence

**Intent.** State what happens in work and how it can be evidenced: observed effects, emitted events, traces/logs/metrics, produced reports, measurement outcomes.

**Adjudication.** In‑work: checked by running/operating and inspecting carriers produced in work.

**Canonical form.** An `E-*` statement **SHOULD** include the minimum fields needed for adjudication:

1. **Observation/measurement conditions** (when/where/how observed; workload/window; triggers)
2. **Carrier class/schema reference** (A.7 Carrier) that bears the evidence
3. **Viewpoint/consumer** (who uses this evidence and why; ties to `viewpointRef` discipline)

**Prohibitions.**

* `E-*` statements **SHOULD NOT** use RFC deontic keywords (they are not obligations; they describe adjudicable effects/evidence).
* An `E-*` statement **MUST NOT** hide a gate predicate; gate predicates are `A-*`.
* An `E-*` statement **MUST NOT** assign agency (“the interface guarantees …”); if enforceability/commitment is intended, express it as `D-*` referencing the `E-*`.

**A.7 anchoring.** `E-*` claims are primarily **Carrier‑anchored**: they assert what carriers exist and how they relate to observed work.

**Required references (explicit).**

* If the effect/evidence is conditioned on a gate decision, the `E-*` statement **SHOULD** reference the relevant `A-*` ID(s).
* If the evidence is interpreted using metric definitions or invariants, the `E-*` statement **SHOULD** reference relevant `L-*` ID(s).

### A.6.B:6 — Cross‑quadrant link discipline

The square is not just classification; it is a **dependency discipline**. Claims often depend on each other; such dependencies **MUST** be explicit (by claim ID) rather than duplicated prose.

#### A.6.B:6.1 — Explicit reference rule

If a claim’s meaning materially depends on another routed claim, that dependency **MUST** be represented as an explicit reference to the other claim’s ID (or to the canonical location where it lives), rather than by restating it.

**Guideline (informative).** Treat this as “import hygiene” for prose: reuse by reference, not by copy.

#### A.6.B:6.2 — Canonical cross‑quadrant dependency patterns

These patterns are valid (and common). The square becomes operational when these links are used systematically.

##### A.6.B:6.2.1 - (D → A) Duty-to-gate linkage

When governance requires someone to comply with a gate:

* `D-*`: “Role **MUST** satisfy/enforce `A-*`.”

This separates **what is admissible** (A) from **who is responsible** (D).

##### A.6.B:6.2.2 - (E → A) Evidence-for-gate linkage

When gate decisions must be observable:

* `E-*`: “On rejection/acceptance due to `A-*`, carrier `C` is produced/observable under conditions …”

This separates **gate semantics** (A) from **evidence semantics** (E).

##### A.6.B:6.2.3 - (D → E) Duty-to-evidence linkage

When governance requires evidence production/retention/exposure or commits to measured properties:

* `D-*`: “Role **MUST** retain/expose carrier class `C` used by `E-*` …”
* `D-*`: “Provider **SHALL** meet `E-*` under exclusions …”

This separates **obligation/commitment** (D) from **adjudication** (E).

##### A.6.B:6.2.4 - (A/E → L) Semantic grounding linkage

When a gate predicate or measurement relies on definitions/invariants:

* `A-*` / `E-*` references `L-*` that define terms/metrics.

This prevents “metric drift” and “definition drift” across views.

##### A.6.B:6.2.5 - (D → L) Governance-to-definition linkage

When an obligation/commitment relies on precise term or metric meanings:

* `D-*` references `L-*` that define the terms/metrics it uses.

This keeps governance text from accidentally redefining semantics in prose.
#### A.6.B:6.3 — The “triangle decomposition” for mixed sentences

**Normative rule (decomposition).** A conforming boundary text **SHALL** decompose any mixed sentence that expresses (i) an entry condition, (ii) an obligation to satisfy/enforce it, and (iii) an observability expectation into the three quadrants:

* **A:** admissibility predicate (`A-*`)
* **D:** duty/commitment referencing the gate (`D-* → A-*`)
* **E:** evidence binding referencing the gate (and carriers) (`E-* → A-*`)

This is the canonical repair for “contract soup” around validity, authorization, compliance, audit, and security boundaries.

#### A.6.B:6.4 — Dependency direction (no “upward” imports)

The square is intended to preserve **layered modularity**: semantics should not depend on governance text, and evidence semantics should not depend on duties.

**Normative rule (no upward dependencies).**

* `L-*` claims **MUST NOT** depend on or reference `A-*`, `D-*`, or `E-*` claims (except for purely informative notes explicitly marked informative).
* `A-*` claims **MUST NOT** depend on or reference `D-*` claims. (`A-*` may reference `L-*` for defined terms/invariants.)
* `E-*` claims **MUST NOT** depend on or reference `D-*` claims. (`E-*` may reference `A-*` for conditioning and `L-*` for metric/term meanings.)
* `D-*` claims **MAY** reference `L-*`, `A-*`, and/or `E-*` claims as needed, and **SHOULD** do so by ID rather than restating content.

**Rationale (informative).** This keeps foundational meaning stable (L), keeps runtime gates independent of governance prose (A), and keeps evidence semantics independent of enforcement policy (E). Governance (D) is the place where “who must do what, using which gates and which evidence” is assembled.

### A.6.B:7 — Mini‑artifact: Claim Register (informative, recommended)

A Claim Register is a drift‑control device that lists every routable statement verbatim with routing metadata. It is not a new semantic layer.

| ID | Quadrant | Statement (verbatim) | Canonical location (section/artefact) | Stack layer | A.7 primary layer | viewRef | viewpointRef | References | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Guidance (informative):
* The **Statement** cell should contain the normative text as authored (copy/paste), not a paraphrase.
* **Canonical location** should point to the one place the statement “lives” (e.g., `Signature.Laws`, `Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions`, `TechCard.NormsCommitments`, `Evidence.Carriers`), so other faces can cite it by ID.
* **Stack layer** should be one of `{Signature, Mechanism, Norms/Commitments, Evidence/Carriers}` to make routing auditable.
* **A.7 primary layer** is the claim’s *primary referent* (`Object`, `Description`, or `Carrier`), even though the claim is always written as a Description.
* Use **References** for explicit cross‑quadrant links (e.g., which `D-*` enforces which `A-*`, which `E-*` adjudicates which commitments, which `L-*` defines a metric used by `E-*`) and for external standards/policies where applicable.

### A.6.B:8 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

> **Informative.** Examples for learning the square; they do not add requirements beyond A.6.B:10.

#### A.6.B:8.1 - Tell (universal rule)

A boundary remains evolvable and auditable when every normative statement is decomposed into atomic claims, each claim is routed to exactly one quadrant of the Boundary Norm Square, and cross‑quadrant dependencies are expressed by explicit claim‑ID references rather than paraphrase.

#### A.6.B:8.2 - Show #1: Effect signature vs handler (post‑2015 effect systems)

A service boundary naturally mirrors **algebraic effects & handlers** practice (popularized broadly in the post‑2015 era, with mainstream effect handlers becoming especially prominent around OCaml 5):

* **L:** defines the operation vocabulary and laws (effect signature semantics).
* **A:** defines when the operation is admissible (runtime guard predicates).
* **D:** states who must enforce guards and what the provider commits to (operator/implementer duties; SLAs).
* **E:** ties “what happened” to observable carriers (traces/logs/metrics/events) so commitments can be adjudicated.

The square prevents accidentally writing handler obligations as laws or treating observability as a definition.

#### A.6.B:8.3 - Show #2: ML evaluation protocol boundary (reproducibility discipline)

A published “evaluation protocol” boundary (common in modern ML governance) benefits from strict routing:

* **L:** metric definitions and invariants (e.g., what counts as AUROC; data partition invariants).
* **A:** admissibility gates (dataset usage-term constraints; pinned environment constraints; seed policy).
* **D:** checker and author duties (publish required faces; use declared dataset version; retention duties for run artifacts).
* **E:** evidence carriers (run logs, hashes, reports, trace IDs) and adjudication conditions (which viewpoint measures, what windows).

The square keeps “must use dataset vX” (D) separate from “evaluation is admissible iff dataset usage terms match” (A), and both separate from “a run produced report carrier R with hash h” (E).

#### A.6.B:8.4 — Worked Rewrite Kit (informative, recommended)

> **Informative.** This kit is a worked, copy‑pasteable restatement of A.6.B’s rules (atomicity, L/A/D/E routing, explicit references, triangle decomposition, and no‑upward dependencies). If anything here conflicts with A.6.B, **A.6.B is authoritative**.

##### A.6.B:8.4.0 - Goal

Convert a boundary-ish sentence that mixes “laws / gates / duties / evidence” into:

1. **atomic routed claims** (L/A/D/E),
2. **explicit references by claim ID** (no paraphrase duplication),
3. **a readable recomposition** (Tech + Plain),
4. **a minimal anti-pattern lint** (things we reject / flag).

##### A.6.B:8.4.1 - Micro-procedure (Atomize → Route → Triangle → Link → Anchor → Recompose)

**Step 1 — Atomize.** Split mixed prose into atomic claims; each must route to exactly one quadrant.

**Step 2 — Route (L/A/D/E).**

* **L** if the claim is **truth‑conditional** and adjudicable *in‑description* (inspection, proof/type validation, or model reasoning **over declared assumptions**): definitions, invariants, typing/well‑formedness constraints.
  **Guardrails:** `L-*` MUST NOT (i) use RFC deontic keywords as operators, (ii) encode runtime entry predicates (those are `A-*`), or (iii) assert evidence existence/measurement outcomes (those are `E-*`).
* **A** if it is an *in‑work* **gate predicate**: what the mechanism admits at application time (“admissible iff …”). It is not a duty and MUST NOT be phrased as one.
  **Guardrails:** `A-*` SHOULD be written in predicate form and MUST NOT (i) use RFC deontic keywords as if it were an agent obligation, (ii) claim that evidence/carriers exist (that is `E-*`), or (iii) assign responsibility/enforcement (that is `D-*`).
  *(Do not confuse this with `Signature.Applicability`: applicability scopes intended meaning/use; it is not a runtime entry gate.)*
* **D** if it assigns **duties/commitments** to an accountable role/agent (RFC keywords belong here; “the interface/system promises” does not).
  **Guardrails:** `D-*` MUST name an accountable subject and SHOULD reference `L-*`/`A-*`/`E-*` by ID rather than restating them in new words (to prevent paraphrase drift).
* **E** if it is an *in‑work* truth‑conditional claim about adjudicable effects/evidence: what carriers exist, under what observation conditions, and/or what was observed.
  **Minimum fields (recommended):** (1) observation/measurement conditions, (2) carrier class/schema reference, and (3) viewpoint/consumer.
  **Guardrails:** `E-*` SHOULD NOT use RFC deontic keywords, MUST NOT hide a gate predicate (that is `A-*`), and MUST NOT cite `D-*`.
  *(If the sentence is “Role SHALL measure/retain/expose …”, route that obligation to **D**, even if it is about evidence.)*

**Step 3 — Triangle decomposition.** If the original sentence mixes (i) an entry condition, (ii) an obligation/commitment, and (iii) an observability expectation (a common failure mode with “guarantee/ensure/approved/aligned”), decompose it into:

* **A**: the admissibility predicate (what must be true to treat the claim as applicable),
* **D → A**: who is responsible for keeping/ensuring the predicate,
* **E → A**: what evidence/traces are used to adjudicate the predicate.

**Note (routing sanity).** `D-*` claims are authored in the description even when their compliance is audited via `E-*` claims. Auditing via evidence does not move `D-*` into quadrant E.

**Guideline.** Keep gate semantics independent of specific evidence carriers: write the gate predicate in `A-*`, then bind observability in `E-*` that references the gate (`E → A`). `A-*` claims MUST NOT reference `E-*` (no upward dependencies), even though `E-*` is used to adjudicate gate satisfaction.

**Step 4 — Link by ID, not by paraphrase.** Supported directions (no upward deps):

* `A-*` may cite `L-*`
* `E-*` may cite `L-*` and `A-*`
* `D-*` may cite `L-*`, `A-*`, `E-*`
* Unsupported: `L-*` citing anything; `A-*` or `E-*` citing `D-*`.

**Common link motifs (informative).** The most reusable boundary rewrites use the canonical motifs: `D→A`, `E→A`, `D→E`, `A/E→L`, and `D→L`.

**Step 5 — Anchor (minimal A.7 discipline).**

* Anchor **L** claims in `Signature.Laws` (and mechanism‑local semantic laws if present), and **A** claims in `Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions`.
* Anchor **D** claims to accountable roles/agents and prefer ID references (no restatement of `L-*` / `A-*` content in new words).
* Anchor **E** claims to carriers + observation conditions and **SHOULD** include viewpoint/consumer (minimum: conditions + carrier class/schema + consumer/viewpoint).

**Optional drift-control.** Add each routed claim verbatim to a Claim Register row (A.6.B:7) with canonical location + references so faces can cite by ID without paraphrase.

**Step 6 — Recompose into readable text.**
Produce two surfaces:

* **Tech surface**: a short **routed claim bundle** (sometimes called a “contract skeleton”) listing routed claims + ID references.
* **Plain surface**: a one-paragraph narrative that *summarizes* the bundle and points to IDs (**no new semantics**). If you need a new constraint, add a new atomic routed claim; do not smuggle it into Plain.

##### A.6.B:8.4.2 - Anti-pattern (quick)

* **AP-1 Evidence-free guarantees.** “X guarantees Y” with no E-claims.
* **AP-2 Interface-as-promiser.** Non-agent objects “promise/commit”.
* **AP-3 Gate-as-evidence.** Treating the gate predicate (A) as if it were an observation (E).
* **AP-4 Gate-as-law.** Entry predicates as signature “laws/definitions” (L) instead of `A-*`.
* **AP-5 Adjective smuggling.** “fast/secure/approved/aligned” used instead of qualifiers/slots.
* **AP-6 Paraphrase drift.** Restating L/A content in D or E with changed meaning (instead of citing by ID).
* **AP-7 Deontics in predicates.** RFC keywords (“MUST/SHALL/…”) used as operators inside `L-*` or `A-*` predicates (should be `D-*` that references `L-*`/`A-*`).
* **AP-8 View-fork semantics.** Recomposition/face text introduces new `L/A/D/E` meaning not present in the routed claim set (violates “no new semantics” discipline).
* **AP-9 Applicability-as-gate.** Using `Signature.Applicability` (intended use) as a substitute for `A-*` runtime admission predicates.

##### A.6.B:8.4.3 - Example 1 — Software engineering (SLO-ish API latency)

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.2 - Atomize + Route (L/A/D/E)

**L-API-01 (Definition).**
`p95_latency(window W, population P, unit U, method M)` is defined as … (formal measurement definition).
*(Lives in Signature.Laws or a referenced measurement definition pack.)*

**L-API-02 (Interface signature).**
The API endpoints and parameters are as declared (including parameter passing discipline / units).
*(Signature-level structure.)*

**A-API-01 (Gate predicate: admissibility).**
The claim “p95 < 200ms” is admissible **only under** declared load/profile + deployment region + sampling method + window:
`AdmissibleLatencyClaim := (region=US) ∧ (concurrency≤X) ∧ (payload≤Y) ∧ (W=5m) ∧ (M=HDRHistogram@v…) ∧ (P=requests that match filter F)`
*(References L-API-01 for definition.)*

**D-API-01 (Commitment).**
`ServiceOwner` SHALL meet the latency target `p95_latency < 200ms` when `A-API-01` holds, adjudicated per `L-API-01` using the carriers/observation conditions in `E-API-01`.
*(References L-API-01 and A-API-01 by ID; does not restate them.)*

**D-API-02 (Operational duty).**
`SRE_oncall` SHALL publish incident notes when the commitment `D-API-01` is violated, and SHALL avoid claiming compliance outside `A-API-01`.
*(References D-API-01 and A-API-01 by ID.)*

**E-API-01 (Evidence / carriers).**
For decisions under `A-API-01`, the following carrier **classes** are produced/observable under the declared observation conditions: trace/span IDs, raw histogram artefacts (schema reference), percentile dashboard snapshots, and pinned sampling configuration for window `W`.
**Observation conditions (minimum):** workload/profile selector, sampling method/config pins, and computation method reference (`L-API-01`).
**Viewpoint/consumer (minimum):** the role/view that uses the carriers to adjudicate the gate and/or audit commitments (e.g., SRE/PerfReview).
*(References `A-API-01` and `L-API-01`; avoids RFC deontics; does not smuggle gates. Note: `E-*` MUST NOT cite `D-*`.)*

**D-API-03 (Duty-to-evidence linkage).**
`Operators` SHALL retain/expose the carrier classes referenced in `E-API-01` for the audit window required by policy.
*(References E-API-01 by ID.)*

**E-API-02 (Observed value claim).**
For interval `Γ_time = [t1..t2]` under conditions pinned to `A-API-01` and using carriers in `E-API-01`, observed `p95_latency = 173ms` (computed per `L-API-01`).
*(References A-API-01, L-API-01 and E-API-01.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.3 - Triangle decomposition (explicit)

* **A-API-01** is “the predicate”.
* **D-API-01 → A-API-01** states the commitment under the gate/envelope.
* **E-API-01 → A-API-01** anchors adjudication (carriers used to decide the gate/commitment).
* **D-API-03 → E-API-01** expresses retention/exposure obligations for those carriers.

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.4 - Readable recomposition

**Tech recomposition (routed claim bundle, short):**

* `L-API-01` defines p95 latency computation.
* `A-API-01` specifies when the latency claim is admissible.
* `D-API-01` states the commitment under that envelope.
* `E-API-01` lists adjudicable carriers/conditions used to adjudicate `A-API-01` (and therefore any commitments that reference it).
* `D-API-02` assigns operational incident-note duties.
* `D-API-03` assigns retention/exposure duties for carriers in `E-API-01`.
* `E-API-02` reports observed performance under `A-API-01` for `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`.

**Plain recomposition (one paragraph, readable):**
“The API’s latency target uses the p95 definition in **L-API-01** and is only applicable under the declared operating envelope **A-API-01**. The service owner commits to meeting the <200ms target under that envelope (**D-API-01**). Adjudication uses the telemetry carriers listed in **E-API-01**, which operators must retain/expose (**D-API-03**), and the on-call SRE must publish incident notes when the commitment is violated (**D-API-02**). Under that envelope, the observed p95 over `Γ_time=[t1..t2]` was `173ms` (**E-API-02**).”

##### A.6.B:8.4.4 - Example 2 — Mechanical engineering (fit / coaxiality)

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “This fit ensures coaxiality.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.2 - Atomize + Route

**L-FIT-01 (Definition).**
`coaxiality` is defined relative to a declared base axis and measurement method (datum scheme, instrument, tolerance zone).
*(Truth-conditional: “what it means”.)*

**L-FIT-02 (Interface/boundary structure).**
The boundary relation involves shaft, bushing, datum axis, tolerance class, temperature window, assembly procedure class.
*(Signature-level arity recovery / slots.)*

**A-FIT-01 (Gate predicate).**
The coaxiality claim is admissible only if manufacturing and assembly satisfy the declared process envelope: material batch, temperature window, tool calibration validity, surface finish class, alignment procedure version.
*(Gate predicate; can be checked using evidence, but is not itself evidence.)*

**D-FIT-01 (Duty).**
`ProcessEngineer` SHALL ensure A-FIT-01 holds for the production lot and SHALL not release the lot for use when A-FIT-01 is false.
*(References A-FIT-01.)*

**E-FIT-01 (Evidence carriers).**
Evidence carriers used to adjudicate `A-FIT-01` include CMM reports, tool calibration certificates, assembly logs, temperature traces, and datum scheme pins.
*(References A-FIT-01 and L-FIT-01; avoids RFC deontics.)*

**D-FIT-02 (Duty-to-evidence linkage).**
`QualityEngineer` SHALL retain/expose the carriers referenced in `E-FIT-01` for the production lot.
*(References E-FIT-01 by ID.)*

**E-FIT-02 (Observed).**
For lot `L123` and window `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, under conditions pinned to `A-FIT-01` and using carriers in `E-FIT-01`, measured coaxiality was within tolerance zone `T` (interpreted per `L-FIT-01`).
*(References A-FIT-01, L-FIT-01, and E-FIT-01.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.3 - Readable recomposition

**Tech bundle:**

* Meaning of coaxiality: `L-FIT-01`.
* Boundary arity/participants: `L-FIT-02`.
* When the claim is admissible: `A-FIT-01`.
* Who is responsible: `D-FIT-01`.
* What we observe and keep as carriers: `E-FIT-01` and measured outcome `E-FIT-02` (with retention duty `D-FIT-02`).

**Plain paragraph:**
“‘Ensures coaxiality’ is made precise by fixing the definition and datum scheme (**L-FIT-01**) and by making the boundary participants explicit (**L-FIT-02**). The coaxiality claim is only applicable under the declared manufacturing/assembly envelope (**A-FIT-01**), which the process engineer is accountable for maintaining (**D-FIT-01**). Compliance is adjudicated using the measurement and process carriers listed in **E-FIT-01**; for lot `L123` over `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, the observed coaxiality was within tolerance **E-FIT-02**.”

##### A.6.B:8.4.5 - Example 3 — Management (project “approved/aligned”)

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “The project is approved.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.2 - Atomize + Route

**L-PRJ-01 (Definition).**
`approved(project, approvalKind)` is defined as a relation kind; approval kinds include: “sponsor-signoff”, “stage-gate-pass”, “budget-authorized”, “staffing-assigned”, etc.
*(Truth-conditional: disambiguates kind and polarity.)*

**A-PRJ-01 (Gate predicate: stage entry).**
For starting execution work, `ExecutionAdmissible(project)` holds iff required approvals are present *and* required prerequisites are satisfied (e.g., risk review completed, budget line exists, key roles staffed).
*(This is the real “may start work” gate; references L-PRJ-01 for what counts as approvals.)*

**D-PRJ-01 (Duty).**
`ProjectOwner` SHALL not initiate execution unless `A-PRJ-01` holds, SHALL keep the approval registry current, and SHALL retain/expose the evidence carriers referenced in `E-PRJ-01`.
*(References A-PRJ-01 and E-PRJ-01 by ID.)*

**E-PRJ-01 (Evidence carriers).**
Evidence carriers used to adjudicate `A-PRJ-01` include: signed decision record IDs, meeting minutes pins, budget system references, staffing assignment records, and gate checklist snapshots.
*(References A-PRJ-01; avoids RFC deontics.)*

**E-PRJ-02 (Observed state).**
As of `Γ_time=snapshot(t)`, a resolvable gate-status carrier (e.g., `GateChecklistSnapshot#…`) indicates `A-PRJ-01` holds, with the referenced evidence set pinned as `{DecisionRecord#…, BudgetLine#…, StaffingAssignments#…}` (carrier classes as per `E-PRJ-01`).
*(Observed / pinned state; references `A-PRJ-01` and `E-PRJ-01`; includes carrier instance(s), not just carrier classes.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.3 - Readable recomposition

**Tech bundle:**

* “Approved” is not one relation: `L-PRJ-01` defines approval kinds.
* “May start execution” is a gate predicate: `A-PRJ-01`.
* Owner accountability: `D-PRJ-01`.
* Carriers and adjudication: `E-PRJ-01` and observed snapshot `E-PRJ-02`.

**Plain paragraph:**
“Instead of a generic ‘approved’, we select an explicit approval kind as defined in **L-PRJ-01** and treat ‘may start execution’ as an admissibility gate (**A-PRJ-01**). The project owner is accountable for not starting execution unless that gate holds and for keeping the approval registry current (**D-PRJ-01**). Gate status is adjudicated using the pinned carriers listed in **E-PRJ-01**; as of snapshot `t`, the evidence indicates the gate holds (**E-PRJ-02**).”

###### A.6.B:8.4.6.2 - Plain register (1 paragraph)

> “We mean **[short label]** in the sense of **L-…**. It’s only meant to be used when **A-…** holds. **[Role]** is responsible for maintaining that condition (**D-…**). Whether it holds is checked using **E-…**, and the latest recorded status/value is **E-…**.”

### A.6.B:9 — Bias‑Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** for boundary descriptions.

* **Arch bias:** favors explicit separation and explicit references; mitigated by allowing narrative faces while keeping commitments routed and referenced by ID.
* **Gov bias:** makes accountability explicit (D) and auditability explicit (E); mitigated by keeping evidence conceptual and carrier‑anchored rather than tool‑specific.
* **Onto/Epist bias:** insists on Object≠Description≠Carrier and on work‑adjudicated effects; mitigated by providing clear cross‑quadrant link patterns so authors can still express real‑world governance needs.

| **Auditability by construction.** Commitments can be linked to adjudicable evidence carriers.                | Requires evidence to be designed; mitigated by keeping evidence conceptual and carrier‑anchored. |
| **Reduced semantic drift across faces.** IDs + explicit references prevent accidental divergence.            | More cross‑references; mitigated by a Claim Register (optional but recommended).                 |

### A.6.B:13 — Rationale

The square is the smallest authoring primitive that forces an explicit choice along two axes that are otherwise routinely conflated:

* **Truth vs governance** (what is the case vs what is required/committed), and
* **Description vs work** (what can be decided by reading vs what must be decided by observing execution).

By requiring atomicity and explicit cross‑quadrant references, the square converts “contract talk” into a set of routed, evolvable claims with clear adjudication semantics.

### A.6.B:14 — SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

> **Informative.** Alignment notes; not normative requirements.

**Representative sources (post‑2015; illustrative).** See also A.6:11 for a fuller list.
* ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 (view/viewpoint discipline).
* Leijen (2017) / Hillerström & Lindley (2018) (effects & handlers).
* OpenTelemetry Specification (v1.0+, 2021–) (evidence carriers as traces/logs/metrics).

* **Effect systems & handlers:** clear separation between operation signature (L) and handler/runtime behavior (A/E), with governance duties (D) attached to accountable operators/implementers.
* **Behavioural/session typing:** protocol laws (L) and admissibility (A) remain distinct from commitments (D) and runtime traces (E), improving interpretability of “progress/safety” style boundary guarantees.
* **SRE/observability discipline:** treating traces/logs/metrics as evidence carriers (E) and separating evidence semantics from retention/exposure duties (D) mirrors contemporary operational practice while staying tool‑agnostic.

### A.6.B:15 — Relations

* **Used by A.6:** supplies the canonical matrix and cross‑quadrant link discipline that A.6 references as “Boundary Discipline Matrix”.
* **Constrains A.6.0 (`U.Signature`):** enforces that `L-*` laws are truth‑conditional and do not include admissibility predicates.
* **Constrains A.6.1 (`U.Mechanism`):** enforces that admissibility lives in `AdmissibilityConditions` (`A-*`) and that evidence semantics are routed as `E-*` with carrier anchors.
* **Requires A.7:** anchors quadrants to Object/Description/Carrier so agency and evidence are not misattributed.
* **Interacts with MVPK/E.17:** faces are projections that cite routed claims; faces must not mint new semantic commitments.

### A.6.B:15a - Probe-coupled boundary claim routing

Probe-coupled boundary language does not create a fifth quadrant. A boundary sentence that says a question, metric, dashboard, workshop, bridge, or API read changes the represented state must still be atomized through the same L/A/D/E square.

Action path:

1. Copy the boundary sentence being used for a decision.
2. Split it into atomic claims before judging it: definition/law, admissibility/use condition, role commitment, and work/evidence effect.
3. Give each atomic claim its quadrant and identifier.
4. Put the state/probe/update/export part in the quadrant where it belongs rather than treating "quantum-like boundary" as one claim.
5. Route reusable relation words through `A.6.P` / `F.18`; route evidence through `A.10`; route assurance through `B.3`; route measurement through `C.16`; route the remaining probe-coupled burden through `C.26.1`.
6. Emit a Claim Register row set or equivalent routed claim set only when the sentence is decision-bearing, reusable, contested, assurance-facing, or likely to be cited across faces.

For a local working note, the lighter action is enough: atomize the sentence mentally, write one clean routed sentence, and avoid the phrase "quantum-like boundary" as a single claim. Use the Claim Register when the routed claim set must survive reuse or dispute.

| Quantum-like boundary phrase hides | Route through | What the user writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The term, variable, state, frame, or relation being defined | `L-*` law/definition claim | Definition or invariant, without agent obligation language |
| When a probe, metric, question, or bridge use is usable for the intended decision | `A-*` admissibility/use claim | Use condition, supported use, unsupported use, and reroute |
| Who is responsible for applying, retaining, exposing, or not overusing the probe result | `D-*` role/commitment claim | Accountable role and referenced L/A/E claim IDs |
| What work effect, carrier, trace, report, metric, or observed before/after state supports the claim | `E-*` work-effect/evidence claim | Carrier, observation condition, time window, and evidence route |

Useful outputs:

- a Claim Register row set when the boundary sentence mixes claim kinds;
- one rewritten routed sentence when the case is only a local working note;
- an ordinary A.6.B routed claim set when no QL burden remains;
- a C.26.1 route only for the remaining probe-coupled state-reading part;
- an A.10/B.3/C.16/F.9 route when evidence, assurance, measurement, or bridge work is the real burden.

Do not write "the boundary is quantum-like" as one unrouted claim. The action is: split the claim, route the pieces, then decide whether `C.26.1` still has a remaining job.
