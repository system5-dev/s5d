## A.19.SURF-SPACE - Cross-Surface / Cross-Space Substrate

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

**Plain-name.** Cross-surface / cross-space substrate.

**Governed object.** The declared relation-and-ref-position stack that links one recoverable source surface to search-side and outcome-side references over `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`, states how those two refs relate, and makes the source-to-outcome relation plus its distortion, uncertainty, or error posture explicit enough to guide use.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:0 - Use this when

Use this pattern when one working line depends on all of the following at once:

- one declared source surface still matters and must stay recoverable by name;
- one search-side space reference and one outcome-side space reference must both be explicit;
- the line must say whether those refs resolve to one declared `CharacteristicSpace` or to two distinct declared `CharacteristicSpace` declarations;
- the source-to-outcome relation is load-bearing enough that the reader must know what is being related, in which direction, and through which declared carrier or support;
- and distortion, uncertainty, or error cannot be left as vague atmosphere.

This is the right pattern for QD, OEE, archive/front, or adjacent synthesis lines when the problem is no longer only "what space exists?" and not yet "what shortlist or shipped surface do we publish?".

Not this pattern when:

- you only need to declare or compare `CharacteristicSpace` itself, with no source-surface or source-to-outcome burden; use `A.19`;
- you are publishing selector or shipping metadata such as `SelectorOutcomeKind`, `SetSurfaceKind`, `HandoffKind`, or public shortlist identity; use `G.5` or `G.10`;
- you are building one interpretive or support view over an already-declared substrate; use `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` or a local specialization such as `G.2`;
- you are deciding live pool policy, frontier retention, or next-move planning; use `C.19` or `C.24`.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

If this pattern is missed, authors usually collapse several different things into one vague "space" or one vague "projection":

- the declared source surface disappears behind bare words such as `front`, `archive`, `palette`, or `portfolio`;
- `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` never become explicit, or `SpaceRefRelationKind` never becomes explicit, so one line silently hides whether search and outcome use one declared space twice or two different declared spaces;
- `DescriptorMapRef` or `DistanceDefRef` gets mistaken for the space itself rather than one representation or metric support;
- publication metadata in `G.5` or `G.10` starts standing in for substrate semantics;
- and distortion, uncertainty, or error is either hidden or treated as if every non-trivial case were only one bridge-loss story.

The result looks tidy, but the reader cannot tell what is being searched, what is being evaluated, what is only being published, and where uncertainty actually enters.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:0.2 - What this buys

This pattern buys one conservative but expressive contract:

- the active source surface stays visible;
- the search-side and outcome-side references over `A.19` spaces stay distinct;
- the relation between those refs becomes inspectable instead of being hidden in one overloaded noun or verb;
- heavier support pins remain available without being forced into every case;
- and support-view or publication neighbors can reuse the substrate without changing what it means.

The practical payoff is simple: readers can tell what the line is acting on, what relation between the two space refs it assumes, what kind of qualification they must keep in view, and which neighboring pattern owns the next move if that burden grows.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:0.a - TERM/LEX token-status guard (local-first)

Keep this token-status split explicit:

- `CharacteristicSpace` is the reused `A.19` kind. This pattern does not mint a second space kind.
- `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` are role-named local fields whose slot content is typed by the existing `CharacteristicSpaceRef` / `SpaceRef` idiom. They are not new heads, not slot aliases inside the space, and not `U.Role` claims. In cross-surface support or typed-set-view passages, read them as role-specific refinements of that older `SpaceRef` idiom rather than collapsing the roles back into one umbrella `SpaceRef`.
- `SpaceRefRelationKind` is a local relation-kind field over those two refs. In this slice, `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` and `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom` are controlled token values for that field, not free prose.
- `SourceToOutcomeRelation` and `DistortionPosture` are local declaration fields. Their field names do not by themselves create one new generic ontology; the burden is satisfied only when their payload is explicit enough to audit.
- `SourceSurfaceKind`, `SourceSurfaceComposition`, and `DerivedViewKind` are local fields in this substrate record. Whether any value later becomes a broader stable head is outside this pattern.
- `BasePaletteRef`, `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, `BridgeDistortionNote`, `DescriptorMapRef`, and `DistanceDefRef` are guarded neighboring refs or support qualifiers reused here. This pattern may cite them, but it does not redefine them.
- `carrier` inside `SourceToOutcomeRelation` names the declared support, declared line, or declared object through which the relation is being realized in this local record. It is not a claim that the thing is `U.Carrier`.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:0.b - First-minute operator cue and confusion map

If you are about to write one line that says what is being searched, what is being judged, and whether those two burdens sit in one declared space or in two declared spaces, stop and fill this pattern before you write any more umbrella prose such as `space`, `projection`, `portfolio`, or `front`.

Do this in the first minute:

1. Name the active source surface.
2. Point `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` to declared `CharacteristicSpace`.
3. Choose `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` or `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom`.
4. State the source-to-outcome relation in direction, mode, and carrier.
5. State the governing posture token.

If one of those five cells cannot yet be filled honestly, do not improvise around it. Either you are still in `A.19`, or you have really moved into support-view work, publication, or policy, or the current line is still missing one declared basis.

| If the live question sounds like... | Use now | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Which space are we searching in and which space are we judging in?" | `A.19.SURF-SPACE` | This pattern governs the dual-ref substrate stack. |
| "How should I help the reader inspect that already-declared line?" | `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` | That is one support reading over the substrate, not the substrate declaration itself. |
| "What do we publish, ship, keep live, or plan next?" | `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24` | Those are downstream output or policy burdens. |
| "I only need one space declaration." | `A.19` | No source-to-outcome substrate stack is in play yet. |

Common confusion to kill early: descriptor maps, distance definitions, and outcome maps may discipline the line, but they do not answer the first-minute substrate question unless the five cells above are already filled.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:1 - Problem frame


In many search, synthesis, and cross-surface lines, the working object is not just one `CharacteristicSpace` and not just one published shortlist or archive either. The line actually depends on a stack such as:

- one declared source surface, for example one front, archive, palette, or another declared source-surface family;
- one search-side reference to an `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`;
- one outcome-side reference to an `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`;
- one explicit `SpaceRefRelationKind` over those two references, stating whether they resolve to the same declared space or to two different declared spaces;
- one relation from the source-side line into the outcome-side line;
- and one declared posture about whether that relation is transparent, approximate, learned, lossy, uncertain, or otherwise qualified.

Without an explicit substrate declaration for that stack, nearby declarations start carrying burdens they are not meant to carry. `A.19` gets stretched from space typing into source-surface governance. `C.18` descriptor maps start masquerading as the whole search space. `G.5` and `G.10` publication fields start reading like ontology. Support views or atlas views drift into default meaning instead of staying optional derived help.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:2 - Problem

How should one declare a cross-surface / cross-space line so that:

1. the declared source surface remains explicit and recoverable;
2. `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` stay guarded refs to declared `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`, not new free-floating space kinds;
3. the text states whether those refs point to one declared space or to two distinct declared spaces;
4. the source-to-outcome relation is explicit enough for the reader to know what is being mapped, projected, translated, scored, or otherwise connected;
5. distortion, uncertainty, and error are stated honestly rather than hidden in prose;
6. `SourceSurfaceComposition` and `DerivedViewKind` remain conditional fields rather than fabricated mandatory baggage;
7. support pins such as `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` remain available but support-only;
8. and neighboring declarations such as `A.19`, `C.18`, `G.5`, `G.10`, and `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` can dock to the substrate without redefining it?

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| `A.19` typing vs adjacent burden | `A.19` already declares `CharacteristicSpace`, but source-surface and publication-surface semantics still need a separate substrate declaration. |
| Precision vs over-typing | The line needs explicit ref positions, an explicit ref-to-ref relation kind, and explicit relation posture, but it should not fabricate composition, derivation, metrics, or transition support when the case does not need them. |
| Reuse vs semantic collapse | `DescriptorMapRef`, `DistanceDefRef`, `OutcomeMapRef`, or `BridgeDistortionNote` are useful supports, but they must not silently become the whole substrate. |
| User readability vs architectural honesty | Cold readers need a first-minute explanation, while stronger readers still need exact boundaries and docking rules. |
| Support views vs substrate core | Atlas or support-view lines can be valuable, but they should remain optional derived help rather than the default meaning of the substrate. |
| Uncertainty honesty vs fake closure | Many current lines use learned, adaptive, unstructured, or distribution-valued spaces or relations; the pattern must expose that posture without pretending the heaviest contract is already settled. |

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4 - Solution

Declare the cross-surface / cross-space line through one explicit substrate stack, keep only the load-bearing core mandatory, and route every heavier burden to conditional fields, support qualifiers, or companion declarations.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.1 - Governed object and outside work

Use this pattern to declare only the substrate stack below:

- the declared source surface that the line is acting on;
- the recoverable concrete source-surface identity when the family name alone would be ambiguous;
- the search-side reference to one declared `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`;
- the outcome-side reference to one declared `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`;
- the explicit `SpaceRefRelationKind` over those two ref positions;
- the explicit source-to-outcome relation;
- and the explicit distortion, uncertainty, or error posture for that relation.

Do not use this pattern to declare:

- `A.19` space typing itself;
- selector outcome publication, shortlist identity, or shipping closure;
- live pool policy or enactment planning;
- or optional support-view families that interpret or reorganize an already-declared substrate.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.2 - Minimal declaration stack

Use the following notation-independent stack:

```text
CrossSurfaceCrossSpaceSubstrate := <
  SourceSurfaceKind,
  SourceSurfaceId?,
  SearchSpaceRef,
  OutcomeSpaceRef,
  SpaceRefRelationKind,
  SourceToOutcomeRelation,
  DistortionPosture,
  SourceSurfaceComposition?,
  DerivedViewKind?,
  BasePaletteRef?,
  OutcomeMapRef?,
  SpaceMetricRef?,
  TransitionSupportRef?,
  BridgeDistortionNote?
>
```

Interpret the fields as follows:

- `SourceSurfaceKind` names the primary declared source-surface family that the line is anchored on.
- `SourceSurfaceId?` names the concrete declared source/set surface when several same-family surfaces are live or when one neighboring owner must be cited to keep that identity unique. It may be omitted only when the concrete source surface is unambiguous from the declared line.
- `SearchSpaceRef` points to one declared `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace` in the search-side position.
- `OutcomeSpaceRef` points to one declared `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace` in the outcome-side position.
- `SpaceRefRelationKind` states how those two refs relate. In ordinary use, the token is either `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` or `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom`.
- `SourceToOutcomeRelation` is one controlled declaration slot. State at least direction, mode, and carrier.
- `DistortionPosture` is one controlled declaration slot with one primary posture token plus optional clarifying note. In this slice, lawful posture tokens include `transparent-for-current-use`, `lossy-bridge`, `metric/model-dependent`, `transition-dependent`, `uncertainty-bearing`, `learned/adaptive`, and `unstable-under-refresh`.
- `SourceSurfaceComposition`, `DerivedViewKind`, and related `...Kind` values remain declaration fields or controlled field values unless some later owner explicitly promotes them; they are not automatically independent heads merely because their names end with `Kind`.

This is an `A.6.5` / `A.6.P` move: `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` are ref-typed slot contents, while `SpaceRefRelationKind` is the explicit `RelationKind` token that governs how those two ref positions are read together.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.3 - Contract laws (SS-0..SS-7)

**SS-0 - One substrate line, one explicit stack.**
Treat a line as declared substrate only if one recoverable source-surface basis, two recoverable space refs, one explicit ref-to-ref relation kind, one explicit source-to-outcome relation, and one explicit posture are present together.

**SS-1 - Ref typing is preserved.**
`SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` must resolve to declared `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`. They do not become parallel space kinds, slot aliases, or role claims.

**SS-2 - Source-surface recoverability is mandatory.**
The reader must be able to recover not only the source-surface family but, when several same-family surfaces are simultaneously live, the concrete declared surface through `SourceSurfaceId?` or one cited neighboring owner that uniquely identifies it.

**SS-3 - Relation burden must be explicit.**
`SourceToOutcomeRelation` is conforming only when direction, mode, and carrier are explicit enough to tell what is related to what, by which route, and through which declared support.

**SS-4 - Posture honesty is mandatory.**
`DistortionPosture` must say whether the line is transparent for current use or qualified by loss, metric/model dependence, transition dependence, uncertainty, learning/adaptation, or instability under refresh. The line may not hide qualification in atmospheric prose.

**SS-5 - Conditional and support fields stay subordinate.**
`SourceSurfaceComposition`, `DerivedViewKind`, `BasePaletteRef`, `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` may clarify the substrate, but they do not replace the core stack and do not become mandatory everywhere.

**SS-6 - Publication and policy stay outside.**
Publication metadata, shortlist identity, live-pool policy, and enactment policy remain neighboring burdens. A substrate line may feed them, but it does not decide them.

**SS-7 - Admission is fail-closed.**
If the source surface cannot be recovered, either space ref is unresolved, `SpaceRefRelationKind` cannot be chosen honestly, relation direction/mode/carrier remains vague, or posture remains unclassified, then the line is not yet a declared substrate. Keep it as a working gloss or reroute it to the owner that can close the missing burden.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.4 - Profiles

Use one of these ordinary profiles:

- **Shared-space profile.**
  `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` both resolve to the same declared `CharacteristicSpace`, and `SpaceRefRelationKind = sameDeclaredSpaceAs`.
- **Cross-space profile.**
  `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` resolve to two distinct declared `CharacteristicSpace` declarations, and `SpaceRefRelationKind = distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom`.
- **Derived-source supplement.**
  If the visible source surface is one derived tradition, front, or palette view, keep `DerivedViewKind` and `BasePaletteRef` explicit so the derived surface does not silently become the default meaning of the base palette or source surface.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.5 - Operational declaration sequence (fail-closed)

When declaring one substrate-bearing line, proceed in this order:

0. **Entry test.** Confirm that the line really needs source-surface plus search/outcome-space plus relation/posture discipline. If it only needs `CharacteristicSpace` typing, use `A.19`. If it only needs publication or policy, route to the downstream owner.
1. **Recover the active source surface.** State `SourceSurfaceKind`. If several same-family surfaces are simultaneously live, fill `SourceSurfaceId?` or cite the neighboring owner that makes that identity unique.
2. **Recover the space refs.** Point `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` to already-declared `CharacteristicSpace`.
3. **Choose the ref-to-ref relation kind.** Declare `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` only when both refs truly resolve to one declared space. Declare `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom` only when they truly resolve to two distinct declared spaces. Do not leave this to reader inference.
4. **State the source-to-outcome relation.** Give direction, mode, and carrier explicitly. If one named `OutcomeMapRef` or neighboring support object carries the relation, cite it. If not, state the carrier directly in prose.
5. **State the posture.** Declare whether the line is transparent for current use or qualified by loss, metric/model dependence, transition dependence, uncertainty, learning/adaptation, or instability under refresh.
6. **Add only the fields that are really doing work.** Add composition, derived-view, base-palette, metric, transition, or bridge qualifiers only when the current case actually depends on them.
7. **Run the boundary check.** If the line starts deciding publication metadata, shortlist identity, live candidate policy, enactment policy, or support-view organization, stop and reroute.

**Fail-closed rule.** Do not treat the line as declared substrate if any of steps 1-5 remains unresolved. Incomplete recovery is a real defect here, not one stylistic omission.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.6 - Canonical rewrite forms

When the line is ready, it should be possible to rewrite it into one of these minimal forms.

**Shared-space form**

```text
SourceSurfaceKind      = ...
SourceSurfaceId?       = ...
SearchSpaceRef         = DeclaredCharacteristicSpace@...
OutcomeSpaceRef        = DeclaredCharacteristicSpace@...
SpaceRefRelationKind   = sameDeclaredSpaceAs
SourceToOutcomeRelation= <direction, mode, carrier>
DistortionPosture      = <posture token; optional note>
```

**Cross-space form**

```text
SourceSurfaceKind      = ...
SourceSurfaceId?       = ...
SearchSpaceRef         = SearchCharacteristicSpace@...
OutcomeSpaceRef        = OutcomeCharacteristicSpace@...
SpaceRefRelationKind   = distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom
SourceToOutcomeRelation= <direction, mode, carrier>
DistortionPosture      = <posture token; optional note>
```

If neither rewrite form can be completed honestly, the line is not yet publishable as substrate-bearing text.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.7 - Conditional fields stay conditional

Use `SourceSurfaceComposition` only when the line genuinely consumes several declared source surfaces.

When composition is active:

- `SourceSurfaceKind` still names the primary family the line is anchored on;
- `SourceSurfaceComposition` names the additional declared source-surface families or the explicit composed-source posture that widens that primary family;
- the composition field does not replace the primary family, and it does not silently retitle the whole line as one different source kind.

Use `DerivedViewKind` only when one derived view is materially active and the reader must be able to recover that derivation.

Use `BasePaletteRef` only when a derived tradition or palette view would otherwise hide the recoverable base palette.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.8 - Support qualifiers stay support-only

`OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` are admitted as support-only qualifiers.

Use them when:

- one declared mapping really disciplines the source-to-outcome relation;
- one metric really disciplines spread, neighborhood, or comparison claims;
- one transition-support object really disciplines dynamic coupling or transfer;
- or one bridge-loss note is the relevant reason the relation is qualified.

Do not make those support qualifiers the semantic center of the substrate. They help explain the relation; they do not replace the line made explicit by `SourceSurfaceKind`, `SourceSurfaceId?`, `SearchSpaceRef`, `OutcomeSpaceRef`, and the declared relation/posture pair.

Qualifier semantics are first declared on the substrate side. Later support views may reuse those qualifiers, but they do not become the place where the qualifier is first invented or materially changed.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.9 - Descriptor maps and distance definitions dock here, but do not replace the space refs

When a neighboring line already uses `DescriptorMapRef` or `DistanceDefRef`, dock it explicitly:

- `DescriptorMapRef` may realize or support the search-side or outcome-side representation burden, as the current line requires;
- `DistanceDefRef` may realize or support the metric burden over that representation on either side, as the current line requires;
- but neither one replaces `SearchSpaceRef` or `OutcomeSpaceRef`;
- and `CharacteristicSpace` remains a different kind from `DescriptorMap`.

Use this docking rule whenever a reader could otherwise mistake one local representation layer for the whole search-side or outcome-side space reference.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.10 - Publication and shipping remain downstream consumers

`G.5` and `G.10` may carry metadata such as `SelectorOutcomeKind`, `SetSurfaceKind`, `SourceSurfaceKind`, `SourceSurfaceComposition`, `DerivedViewKind`, and `BasePaletteRef` when one selected or shipped surface is being published.

That does not mean `G.5` or `G.10` defines the substrate.

Read the boundary this way:

- this pattern defines the substrate that later publication must preserve;
- `G.5` publishes selector-facing outcome metadata;
- `G.10` ships publication metadata and pins;
- neither one redefines the search-side reference, the outcome-side reference, or the source-to-outcome relation.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.11 - Ordinary and heavier use

For ordinary use, one short declaration block is enough:

- one `SourceSurfaceKind`;
- `SourceSurfaceId?` when family-level naming alone would be ambiguous;
- one `SearchSpaceRef`;
- one `OutcomeSpaceRef`;
- one explicit `SpaceRefRelationKind`;
- one explicit relation line;
- one explicit posture line.

Use the heavier stack only when one of these is true:

- several declared source surfaces are genuinely composed;
- one derived view must stay recoverable;
- one support qualifier is materially active;
- one descriptor-map or distance-definition docking clause is needed to prevent collapse;
- or the reader would otherwise mistake publication metadata for substrate semantics.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.12 - Operator kit: choose, declare, self-check, reroute

Use this compact kit whenever the burden is practical declaration rather than one more explanatory paragraph.

| Decision point | What to do now | Lawful result | Stop or reroute when... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1. What is the line acting on?` | Name `SourceSurfaceKind`, and when several same-family surfaces are live also make the concrete source surface recoverable. | The reader can tell which surface the line is about. | The source surface still floats behind one vague family word. |
| `2. Are search and outcome in one declared space or in two?` | Point `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` to declared `CharacteristicSpace`, then choose `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` or `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom`. | The space-role split is explicit. | The same-space versus cross-space question is still being guessed from context. |
| `3. What relation is actually being claimed?` | Write one explicit `SourceToOutcomeRelation` with direction, mode, and carrier. | The reader can inspect what is related to what, by which route. | You are still leaning on one umbrella word such as `projection`, `portfolio`, or `maps into`. |
| `4. What qualification is honest?` | Choose the governing `DistortionPosture` token and add one note only when it really sharpens the case. | The line is honest about loss, uncertainty, learning/adaptation, or other qualification. | Qualification remains atmospheric prose or one fake default of transparency. |
| `5. Which heavier supports are truly active?` | Add only the qualifier fields that the current case actually uses. | Supports stay subordinate to the substrate. | The next burden is really support-view work, publication, or policy. |

Use this minimal worksheet when drafting or repairing one substrate line:

```text
SourceSurfaceKind       = ...
SourceSurfaceId?        = ...
SearchSpaceRef          = ...
OutcomeSpaceRef         = ...
SpaceRefRelationKind    = sameDeclaredSpaceAs | distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom
SourceToOutcomeRelation = <direction, mode, carrier>
DistortionPosture       = <token; optional note>
Optional supports       = <only those actually active>
```

Run this self-check before you leave the line:

- if the worksheet cannot be filled without one hidden assumption, the declaration is not ready yet;
- if the next needed prose is mainly "how should the reader inspect this substrate?", continue in `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW`;
- if the next needed prose is "what gets published, shipped, retained, or enacted?", reroute to `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24`;
- if the current line changes because one neighbor wants different naming, glossing, or repair vocabulary, keep the substrate contract here and let `F.18`, `A.0`, or `A.6.P` handle that neighboring burden explicitly.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:4.13 - Using the substrate with neighboring patterns

Once one substrate line is declared, use neighboring patterns in this order:

- Use `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` when the next burden is interpretive help over the same substrate. The support view may foreground the line, but it does not become the ontology.
- Use `G.2` when that support becomes palette-first, tradition-facing atlas work. Keep the base palette and the cited substrate recoverable while doing it.
- Use `A.6.P` when one passage collapses source surface, space ref, support view, atlas view, or mapping into one umbrella word. Repair the wording back to the substrate contract before adding more theory.
- Use `F.18` when the problem is label choice or naming-side comparison around this stack. Naming notes may explain why one head is better named; they do not settle the substrate relation.
- Use `A.0` when the burden is cold-reader glossing of these tokens. Glosses help recognition; they do not replace the declaration block.

If a neighboring passage would change the source-to-outcome relation or the distortion posture, reopen this pattern first. Neighboring text may reuse the substrate, but it may not silently rewrite it.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:5 - Archetypal Grounding


#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:5.1 - System

**Tell.** One QD line keeps saying that one archive is both the search surface and the evaluation basis. Downstream readers need to see that the same declared `CharacteristicSpace` can still occupy two different role positions without turning the archive or the descriptor layer into the space itself.

**Show.**

```text
SourceSurfaceKind       = Archive
SearchSpaceRef          = BehaviorCharacteristicSpace@ed=12
OutcomeSpaceRef         = BehaviorCharacteristicSpace@ed=12
SpaceRefRelationKind    = sameDeclaredSpaceAs
SourceToOutcomeRelation = archive-retained candidates are navigated and judged
                          for local coverage gain in the same declared behavior
                          space
DistortionPosture       = metric/model-dependent; descriptor realization and
                          neighborhood metric support are active
DescriptorMapRef        = QDDescriptorMap@ed=9
DistanceDefRef          = ArchiveNeighborhoodDistance@ed=4
SpaceMetricRef          = ArchiveNeighborhoodMetric@ed=4
```

**Cash-out.** This line now says three distinct things cleanly: the active source surface is one archive, both role-refs resolve to the same declared `CharacteristicSpace`, and the descriptor map plus distance definition are only support layers over that shared space reference. A downstream selection or archive-maintenance discussion can reuse this line without pretending the archive itself is the space.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:5.2 - Episteme

**Tell.** One synthesis line presents one derived tradition front and then starts speaking as if the visible front were the default meaning of the whole palette.

**Show.**

```text
SourceSurfaceKind       = Front
DerivedViewKind         = TraditionFront
BasePaletteRef          = SoTAPaletteDescriptionId
SearchSpaceRef          = TraditionComparisonSpace@ed=3
OutcomeSpaceRef         = AdoptionOutcomeSpace@ed=2
SpaceRefRelationKind    = distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom
SourceToOutcomeRelation = the visible tradition front is one derived reading
                          over the base palette and is compared against the
                          declared adoption outcome space through one explicit
                          cross-tradition outcome-bearing line
DistortionPosture       = lossy-bridge; derived-view selection and bridge-loss
                          notes must stay visible
BridgeDistortionNote    = CrossTraditionComparisonLossNote@ed=1
```

**Cash-out.** The visible front stays a derived view over the palette, the base palette stays recoverable, and the outcome-side evaluation line stays explicit. A later support view or atlas view may reorganize this story, but it may not silently change the declared source-to-outcome relation or erase the bridge-loss warning.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:5.3 - Boundary anti-case

**Tell.** One note says only that "the shortlist front is the published surface for the current selector result" and names no source-to-outcome relation, no search-side space, no outcome-side space, and no posture.

**Show.** This is not a substrate declaration. It is publication metadata over one already-selected surface.

**Cash-out.** Route that note to `G.5` or `G.10`. Do not pad it with pseudo-substrate words just to make it look deeper than it is.

#### A.19.SURF-SPACE:5.4 - Use-situation spread

Use the pattern this way across different working situations:

| Working situation | What to do with this pattern | What must stay explicit | Common miss avoided |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Archive-side QD line where navigation and evaluation stay in one declared behavior space | Use the shared-space profile. Fill the six core fields, then add descriptor/metric support only if active. | `Archive` as source surface, both role-refs, `sameDeclaredSpaceAs`, and the active posture. | Treating the archive or descriptor layer as if it were the space itself. |
| Derived tradition/front line that is judged against one different outcome space | Use the cross-space profile and keep `DerivedViewKind` plus `BasePaletteRef` visible. | The derived view stays derived, the base palette stays recoverable, and the cross-space relation stays explicit. | Letting the visible front replace the base palette or hiding the bridge-loss posture. |
| Learned, adaptive, or uncertainty-bearing line where the space contract is real but heavier support is still case-bound | Keep the substrate core explicit and choose the honest posture token such as `uncertainty-bearing`, `learned/adaptive`, or `unstable-under-refresh`. | The reader can see that the substrate is real without being promised fake geometric closure. | Pretending every serious case is either fully transparent or fully described by one metric stack. |
| Shortlist or publication note that only says what surface is shown or shipped | Do not use this pattern. Route directly to `G.5` or `G.10`. | The note stays publication-facing instead of imitating substrate depth. | Padding publication metadata with pseudo-substrate language. |

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:6 - Bias-Annotation


- **Gov bias.** The pattern prefers explicit declaration over convenient shorthand.
- **Arch bias.** The pattern keeps substrate, support view, and publication consumers separated even when one merged story would read more smoothly.
- **Prag bias.** The pattern prefers a short explicit contract that can be reused across search, synthesis, and publication-adjacent lines.
- **SoTA bias.** The pattern assumes current QD and OEE work often uses learned, adaptive, unstructured, or uncertainty-bearing spaces and therefore resists premature geometric closure.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:7 - Conformance Checklist

Treat a line as conforming only if every gate below passes.

| ID | Gate question | Fail when | Repair or reroute |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CC-A19SS-1` | Is the line really declaring one substrate-bearing burden rather than only `CharacteristicSpace`, publication metadata, or policy? | The line only names a space object, or only publishes/ships/retains something, with no explicit source/ref/relation/posture stack. | Route to `A.19`, `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24` as appropriate. |
| `CC-A19SS-2` | Is the active source surface recoverable enough for the current case? | Only a vague family word such as `front` or `archive` remains, and several same-family surfaces are live with no way to tell which one is meant. | Add the concrete declared surface id or cite the neighboring owner that makes the surface unique. |
| `CC-A19SS-3` | Do `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` both resolve to declared `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`, and is `SpaceRefRelationKind` explicit? | One or both refs are vague, or the line leaves the same-space versus cross-space question to inference. | Restore the two refs and declare `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` or `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom` explicitly. |
| `CC-A19SS-4` | Is the source-to-outcome relation explicit in direction, mode, and carrier? | The line hides the relation in one umbrella phrase such as `projection`, `portfolio`, or `maps into`, with no explicit carrier. | Rewrite into the canonical substrate form and state direction, mode, and carrier. |
| `CC-A19SS-5` | Is the active qualification posture explicit and honest? | The line is qualified in effect, but the posture is unstated or all non-transparent cases are blurred into one generic loss story. | Declare the governing posture token and any needed note; if that cannot be done honestly, keep the line informative only. |
| `CC-A19SS-6` | Are conditional and support fields used only when they really do work? | Composition, derivation, base-palette, map, metric, transition, or bridge qualifiers are fabricated everywhere or silently become core. | Remove unused qualifiers; keep only the fields the current case actually depends on. |
| `CC-A19SS-7` | If `DescriptorMapRef` or `DistanceDefRef` is active, does the text say they realize or support the burden rather than replace the space ref? | The representation or metric layer is treated as if it were the declared search-side or outcome-side space. | Re-state the docking rule and keep the two space refs visible. |
| `CC-A19SS-8` | Does the line stay out of publication and policy work? | The prose starts deciding shortlist identity, selector outcome, shipping closure, or live-pool/enactment policy. | Split the line and route those downstream burdens to their owning patterns. |
| `CC-A19SS-9` | Can the line be rewritten into one canonical substrate form without invention? | The line still depends on hidden assumptions or unresolved candidates. | Keep it as a working gloss or repair the missing recovery before reuse. |
| `CC-A19SS-10` | Could a cold reader take the next lawful declaration step from this line without surrounding memo help? | The line still speaks only in umbrella words such as `space`, `projection`, or `portfolio`, and the reader cannot tell what to fill next. | Use the substrate worksheet from `4.12` or rewrite into one canonical substrate form before reuse. |
| `CC-A19SS-11` | When the next burden is support-view, publication, or policy, is the reroute explicit? | The text keeps talking as if substrate, support, publication, and policy were one layer, so the reader cannot tell where to continue. | Split the line and cite `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW`, `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24` as the next owner. |
| `CC-A19SS-12` | Does the current use claim only the breadth it actually supports? | The prose implies universal geometric closure or one universal heavy-support story, but the declared posture or supports stay narrower, uncertain, learned/adaptive, or case-bound. | Narrow the claim explicitly or add the missing posture/support qualifiers that make the broader claim honest. |

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them


| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Treating one archive or front as the search space itself | A source surface is not the same kind as one declared `CharacteristicSpace`. | Keep `SourceSurfaceKind` and `SearchSpaceRef` separate. |
| Leaving `SpaceRefRelationKind` implicit | The reader then has to guess whether search and outcome share one declared space or use two distinct declared spaces. | Declare `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` or `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom` next to the two refs. |
| Letting `DescriptorMapRef` stand in for the whole substrate | A representation layer is not the same thing as the position-typed space contract. | State the docking rule explicitly and keep the space refs visible. |
| Making `SourceSurfaceComposition` or `DerivedViewKind` mandatory in every line | The line fabricates composition or derivation where none exists. | Keep them conditional. |
| Publishing with bare `portfolio` language | `portfolio` blurs retained-set, selected-set, and posture talk. | Use declared source-surface and outcome metadata instead. |
| Treating all distortion as one bridge story | Not every qualified relation is bridge-mediated. | State the active posture directly. |
| Letting `G.5` or `G.10` sound like the substrate itself | Publication metadata then silently replaces substrate semantics. | Keep publication as downstream use of the substrate. |

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

- Readers can see what the line is acting on, what spaces it distinguishes, what relation is declared between the two space refs, and what outcome burden it claims.
- `A.19`, `C.18`, `G.5`, and `G.10` stay coordinated without collapsing into one layer.
- Heavier supports such as maps, metrics, transitions, and bridge-loss notes remain usable without being forced into every first slice.

**Trade-offs**

- The line must expose one explicit relation and one explicit posture instead of hiding them in umbrella prose.
- Some cases that used to look "simple" will expose real uncertainty or loss that now needs to be declared.
- Neighboring support-view or publication patterns may need to be read as companions rather than assumed from local shorthand.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:10 - Rationale

The pattern chooses a narrow but sturdy center of gravity.

`A.19` already declares `CharacteristicSpace`. The missing burden is not another free-floating space kind. It is the ref-position and relation stack that tells the reader:

- which declared source surface is active;
- which declared space is named in the search-side position;
- which declared space is named in the outcome-side position;
- what `SpaceRefRelationKind` says about those two refs;
- and how much transparency, distortion, uncertainty, or error the line is honestly claiming.

That is why this pattern stops before support views and before publication metadata. If it tried to say less, the burden would collapse back into vague `space` or `projection` talk. If it tried to say more, it would start absorbing views, fronts, archives, shortlists, or shipping semantics that belong elsewhere.

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| SoTA practice | Primary source(s) | Pressure disciplined here | Practical safeguard bought | Adoption stance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modern multilevel evolutionary theory looks for one common substrate across several levels rather than forcing one tradition-local carrier to tell the whole story. | Vanchurin (2026) on generally covariant evolutionary dynamics; Warrell et al. (2024) on unified multilevel evolutionary frameworks. | `SS-0`, `SS-2`, `CC-A19SS-1`, `CC-A19SS-2`. | Keeps one neutral substrate beside `A.19`, so one archive, front, or publication surface cannot silently stand in for the whole burden. | **Adapt.** Keep one neutral substrate, but bind it to FPF declaration discipline. |
| Contemporary QD practice distinguishes feature/behavior space, quality/objective side, archive/repertoire surfaces, and local competition rather than treating one vague "space" as enough. | 2026 QD review; IJCAI 2024 stepping-stone results; MOUR-QD (2025). | `SS-1`, `SS-3`, `CC-A19SS-3`, `CC-A19SS-4`, worked slices `5.1` and `5.2`. | Forces search-side ref, outcome-side ref, and source-to-outcome relation to stay explicit, so downstream search/evaluation claims remain auditable. | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt the split; adapt it to FPF declared-source-surface discipline. |
| Frontier QD and adjacent work increasingly use learned, adaptive, unstructured, and uncertainty-bearing spaces and supports, so one heavy metric or transition stack should not be assumed everywhere. | Uncertain Quality-Diversity (2023); Extract-QD (2025); later adaptive-space and meta-competition lines. | `SS-4`, `SS-5`, `CC-A19SS-5`, `CC-A19SS-6`. | Makes uncertainty posture explicit while keeping map, metric, transition, and bridge-loss pins optional unless the case truly depends on them. | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt uncertainty honesty and optional heavier supports; reject mandatory geometric monoculture. |
| Atlas and manifold-support lines are useful in some cases, but they are not the default meaning of every cross-surface line. | UMAP 2024 review; 2024-2025 atlas and manifold-optimization lines. | `SS-5`, `SS-6`, boundary anti-case `5.3`, `CC-A19SS-8`. | Preserves substrate semantics so later support or atlas views can help interpretation without quietly becoming the ontology. | **Adapt.** Keep atlas-strength support as a later specialization, not the substrate's ordinary center. |

### A.19.SURF-SPACE:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `A.19`, `A.17`, `A.18`.
- **Coordinates with:** `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, `G.10`, `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW`, `A.6.P`, `A.0`.
- **Specialized by:** `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` and later support-view or atlas specializations when one line needs derived interpretation over an already-declared substrate.
- **Does not replace:** selector outcome publication, shipping metadata, live pool policy, or enactment planning.
