## A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW - Cross-Surface Support View

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

**Plain-name.** Cross-surface support view.

**Governed object.** One declared support-only view over one already-declared cross-surface / cross-space substrate-bearing basis, written as a domain-specific use-site under existing `U.EpistemicViewing` / `U.MultiViewDescribing` law, so the reader can inspect one substrate through thinner or stronger support lenses without changing the substrate, the publication surface, or the object of talk. In this slice, the lawful basis is either the explicit substrate line itself or one declared source/set-surface entry point through which that substrate remains recoverable.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:0 - Use this when

Use this pattern when one already-declared substrate from `A.19.SURF-SPACE` is already in force, and the current passage either cites that substrate directly or works through one declared source/set-surface entry point that keeps the substrate recoverable, but the reader still needs one support view to see how the line should be read in practice.

Typical signs are:

- the substrate is already declared, but one thinner interpretive view is still needed so the active source surface, search-side space, outcome-side space, or distortion posture stays understandable;
- one stronger atlas-form reading may help collect several typed set views, active set surfaces, cited spaces, mappings, or support qualifiers without changing the underlying substrate;
- one derived tradition or palette view must stay recoverable as a view over a base palette rather than silently becoming the palette's default meaning;
- or one line needs optional support pins such as `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, or `BridgeDistortionNote`, but those pins must stay supporting qualifiers rather than the semantic center.

This is the right pattern when the working need is no longer "what substrate is declared?" and not yet "what shortlist, publication surface, or shipped result do we emit?".

Not this pattern when:

- you still need to declare the substrate itself, including source-surface and search/outcome-space roles; use `A.19.SURF-SPACE`;
- you only need `CharacteristicSpace`, its slots, or its typing hooks; use `A.19`;
- you are publishing selector outcomes, shortlist identity, or shipping metadata; use `G.5` or `G.10`;
- you are setting live pool policy, retained-set policy, or enactment/planning posture; use `C.19` or `C.24`;
- you are defining a new generic view law, viewpoint bundle, or publication-view family rather than one domain-specific support reading; use `A.6.3`, `E.17.0`, `E.17`, or `E.17.1`;
- the line would change the described object of talk rather than preserve it; use `A.6.4` or the appropriate retargeting route.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

If this pattern is missed, support work usually fails in one of four ways:

- the substrate is forced to carry every interpretive burden itself, so `A.19.SURF-SPACE` starts reading as if it also owned support views, atlas readings, or palette interpretation;
- the word `view` appears as one fresh local theory, detached from existing `U.EpistemicViewing` and `U.MultiViewDescribing`, so viewpoint, view, and surface start collapsing again;
- one atlas-form reading quietly becomes the default meaning of the whole family, so a stronger support form starts redefining the base palette or base source surface;
- or support pins such as `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` either disappear into vague prose or are promoted into mandatory core everywhere.

The reader then cannot tell whether a visible interpretation is one optional support view, one stronger atlas reading, one publication surface, or one new semantic head.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:0.2 - What this buys

This pattern buys one disciplined middle layer:

- the substrate remains the semantic center;
- thinner support views remain lawful when a full atlas form is unnecessary;
- `CrossSurfaceAtlasView` remains available as one stronger reusable specialization, but not as the default head;
- derived palette or tradition views keep their base palette and base source surfaces recoverable;
- active set surfaces, cited spaces, mappings, and qualifying support stay recoverable when the current reading uses them;
- and publication, shipping, and pool-policy burdens stay outside the view.

The practical payoff is simple: the reader can use one support view to understand the declared line better without mistaking that support view for the line's ontology, output, or policy.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:0.a - TERM/LEX token-status guard (local-first)

Keep this token-status split explicit:

- `CrossSurfaceSupportView` is the ordinary/common support-view head introduced here for domain-specific reuse over one already-declared substrate-bearing basis: either the substrate line itself or one declared source/set surface that keeps the substrate recoverable.
- `CrossSurfaceAtlasView` is the stronger specialization of that same family. It is not the common head and it is not automatically required.
- `TypedSetViews` is one local plural field over already-declared set-view heads or ids. It is not a new generic set-surface ontology.
- `TraditionAtlasView` is one local `G.2` specialization of `CrossSurfaceAtlasView`, not the family head for all support-view use.
- `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` are guarded neighboring refs or support qualifiers reused here. This pattern may foreground them, but it does not mint them.
- `support question` is one local declaration field naming the interpretive burden the current reading helps with. It is not a replacement for `U.Viewpoint`.
- `DerivedViewKind` and `BasePaletteRef` stay local recoverability aids here; they do not silently turn the derived reading into the base ontology.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:0.b - First-minute operator cue and confusion map

Use this pattern only after one substrate is already declared, either cited directly or kept recoverable through one declared source/set surface. The first-minute move here is not "write more about the same space". It is "decide what support question the reader needs answered without changing the object of talk".

Do this in the first minute:

1. Cite the base substrate or the source/set-surface entry point that stays recoverable with it.
2. State the support question in one sentence.
3. Choose thin support or atlas support.
4. Keep the active source surface and any active set surface recoverable.
5. Add only the supports that truly discipline the reading.

If you cannot name the base substrate or the recoverable source/set-surface entry point that carries it, or if the current prose would change the source-to-outcome relation or its posture, stop. You are either repairing the substrate, retargeting the object, or drifting into publication/policy.

| If the live question sounds like... | Use now | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "How do I help the reader inspect the declared substrate?" | `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` | This pattern governs support-only reading. |
| "What is the substrate itself?" | `A.19.SURF-SPACE` | The base line has to exist first. |
| "Which palette-first or tradition-facing atlas reading should I use?" | `G.2` over this family | That is one local specialization of atlas support. |
| "What do we publish, ship, keep live, or plan next?" | `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24` | Those burdens stay outside support views. |

Common confusion to kill early: one visible atlas or metric note does not make atlas form automatically necessary. Thin support is already a complete lawful answer.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:1 - Problem frame


Once one cross-surface / cross-space substrate has been declared, many lines still need one second-order reading surface for ordinary work.

Examples include:

- one archive-centered reading that needs optional metric or transition support to explain why certain regions stay promising;
- one derived tradition or palette reading that must remain visibly derived from a base palette;
- one atlas-form reading that collects several typed set views, active set surfaces, spaces, maps, metrics, or distortion notes so that cross-level structure stays readable;
- one support rendering that helps the reader inspect the declared substrate without turning that rendering into the substrate's default meaning.

Current FPF already points in that direction. `A.6.3` and `E.17.0` already give the general law that views are describedEntity-preserving and do not mint autonomous new semantics. `G.2` already keeps `TraditionAtlasView` as optional neighboring support over one palette and declared set surfaces rather than making atlas semantics the meaning of `Tradition` itself. What is still missing is one common support-view pattern that:

- stays explicitly under existing view law;
- keeps thinner support views lawful;
- keeps atlas form reusable but non-default;
- and keeps support qualifiers optional and recoverable.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:2 - Problem

How should one declare a support view so that:

1. it is explicitly one domain-specific use-site of existing `U.EpistemicViewing` / `U.MultiViewDescribing` law, not one fresh autonomous theory of views;
2. it keeps the already-declared substrate recoverable instead of replacing it;
3. it allows both ordinary thinner support views and one stronger atlas-form support view;
4. it keeps `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` optional and support-only;
5. it keeps derived palette or tradition views recoverable through `DerivedViewKind` and `BasePaletteRef` when those are active;
6. it does not mint new set-surface heads, selector policy, publication policy, or shipping semantics;
7. it lets `G.2` keep `TraditionAtlasView` as one local specialization rather than as the generic head of the whole family;
8. and it fails closed when the line would really be retargeting, new view-law work, substrate repair, publication, or policy?

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Existing view law vs local usefulness | The support view must be useful in local substrate work, but it cannot invent a second `view` ontology beside `A.6.3` and `E.17.0`. |
| Substrate stability vs interpretive help | Readers need one support layer, but that support layer must not redefine the substrate. |
| Thin support vs atlas strength | Some cases need only one light interpretive view; others genuinely need one stronger atlas-form reading. The pattern must support both without making the stronger form default. |
| Recoverability vs convenience | Derived tradition or palette views help reading, but they must not hide the base palette, base source surface, or active declared spaces. |
| Support richness vs semantic inflation | Maps, metrics, transition supports, and distortion notes are often useful, but they must stay optional support qualifiers rather than new mandatory core. |
| Readability vs downstream boundary discipline | The pattern should help cold readers immediately, while still keeping `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, and `C.24` outside the support view. |

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4 - Solution

Declare support views as support-only readings over one already-declared substrate-bearing basis, keep them explicitly under existing view law, and reserve atlas form for the cases that truly need it.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.1 - Governed object and outside work

Use this pattern to declare:

- one `CrossSurfaceSupportView`, the ordinary/common head of this support-view family;
- one support-only reading over one already-declared substrate-bearing basis: either one explicit `A.19.SURF-SPACE` line or one already-declared source/set surface whose supporting spaces, mappings, and qualifiers remain recoverable through such a line;
- the support question that makes this view worth showing;
- the recoverable source surface or source surfaces that the support view is reading;
- any active set surface, derived view, or base palette that the current reading keeps in play;
- any cited spaces or mappings that the current reading depends on, provided those remain recoverable through declared refs or the cited substrate-bearing line;
- and any optional supporting qualifiers that the current view genuinely needs.

`CrossSurfaceAtlasView` is one stronger specialization inside that same family. It is not the common head.

Do not use this pattern to declare:

- `CharacteristicSpace` itself;
- the substrate role/relation stack from `A.19.SURF-SPACE`;
- selector outcomes, shortlist heads, or shipping outputs;
- live pool policy or enactment policy;
- or a new generic law for views, viewpoints, or publication surfaces.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.2 - Minimal support-view contract

A conforming support view makes the following explicit:

- which support-family head is active: ordinary `CrossSurfaceSupportView` or stronger `CrossSurfaceAtlasView`;
- which already-declared substrate-bearing basis it is reading: either the explicit substrate line or the declared source/set-surface entry point that keeps that substrate recoverable;
- which support question the view is answering;
- which source surface or source surfaces must stay recoverable while the view is active;
- which active set surface, if any, the current reading is using over that source surface;
- which cited spaces and mappings, if any, the current reading depends on, and how they remain recoverable;
- which optional supporting qualifiers are genuinely doing work in the current case;
- and which neighboring burdens stay outside this view.

The minimum ordinary contract is therefore:

1. one declared substrate-bearing basis from `A.19.SURF-SPACE`: either the explicit base substrate line or one declared source/set surface whose substrate remains recoverable with it;
2. one explicit support question;
3. one recoverable active source-surface basis, plus any active set surface drawn from it when the reading uses one;
4. any cited spaces, mappings, and qualifying uncertainty/distortion supports remain recoverable whenever the reading cites them;
5. one explicit statement that this is support-only and does not redefine substrate or publication semantics.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.3 - Contract laws (SV-0..SV-8)

**SV-0 - View-law docking is explicit.**
Every conforming support view is one domain-specific use-site under existing `A.6.3` / `E.17.0` law. It does not introduce one autonomous new theory of views.

**SV-1 - The described object of talk is preserved.**
The support view preserves the described object already carried by the base line. If the current prose would change that object, the line is no longer one support view over the same substrate.

**SV-2 - The base substrate remains the semantic center.**
The support view may foreground aspects of the base line, but it does not replace or repair the base substrate contract. Substrate repair belongs back in `A.19.SURF-SPACE`.

**SV-3 - Source, set-surface, and palette recoverability are mandatory.**
The current source surface, any active set surface drawn from it, and any active derived view or base palette must remain recoverable while the support view is active.

**SV-4 - Support qualifiers remain foregrounding devices only.**
`OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` may be foregrounded, but they do not become the support view's ontology and they do not silently change the base relation or posture.

**SV-5 - Thin support and atlas support are different profiles.**
Ordinary `CrossSurfaceSupportView` is a complete lawful profile, not a placeholder. `CrossSurfaceAtlasView` is used only when the stronger composite support burden is real.

**SV-6 - Atlas form requires a complete composite record.**
If atlas form is active, the view must keep the base substrate, the active source or set surface, the relevant `TypedSetViews`, any cited spaces, any cited mappings, and any qualifying support explicit enough that the reader can recover why thin support was not enough.

**SV-7 - Local specialization stays local.**
If `TraditionAtlasView` is used, it remains one `G.2` specialization of `CrossSurfaceAtlasView`; it does not become the common head of the family.

**SV-8 - Admission is fail-closed.**
If the current line would change the described object, add new generic view law, repair the substrate, decide publication, or decide policy, it is not a conforming support view here. Reroute it instead of stretching the family.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.4 - Profiles

Use one of these profiles explicitly:

- **Thin-support profile.**
  Use ordinary `CrossSurfaceSupportView` when one source basis plus one support question is enough, and the current reading does not need several typed set views or several support qualifiers held together at once.
- **Atlas-support profile.**
  Use `CrossSurfaceAtlasView` when the reader must hold several declared views, spaces, mappings, or qualifiers together to understand the same base substrate-bearing line.

If neither profile can be chosen honestly, the line is not ready as support-view text.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.5 - Operational declaration sequence (fail-closed)

When declaring one support view, proceed in this order:

0. **Entry test.** Confirm that one already-declared substrate exists and that the current burden can cite it either directly or through one declared source/set-surface entry point that keeps it recoverable, rather than drifting into substrate repair, publication, or policy.
1. **Name the active support head.** Use ordinary `CrossSurfaceSupportView` unless the current reading genuinely needs the stronger atlas form.
2. **Cite the base line.** Name the already-declared substrate the view is reading, or cite the source/set-surface entry point together with the recoverable substrate it depends on.
3. **State the support question directly.** Say what the view helps the reader see that the substrate alone leaves hard to inspect.
4. **Keep the base surfaces recoverable.** Name the active source surface, and if the view is over one declared front, archive, shortlist, palette, or other set surface drawn from that source, keep that active set surface recoverable too.
5. **Recover derived-view and palette structure when it matters.** If the view depends on one derived tradition or palette reading, state `DerivedViewKind` and `BasePaletteRef`.
6. **Add the actual supports.** Add `TypedSetViews`, cited spaces, mappings, metrics, transition supports, or distortion notes only when the current reading truly depends on them.
7. **Run the preservation check.** If the support prose would materially change the base source-to-outcome relation or the base distortion/uncertainty/error posture, stop and reopen the substrate declaration.
8. **Run the boundary check.** If the prose starts changing the object of talk, minting new generic view law, publishing selected sets, shipping outputs, or deciding policy, reroute.

**Fail-closed rule.** Do not treat the line as a support view if steps 2-7 cannot be completed honestly. Missing base-line recovery or hidden posture change is a real defect here.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.6 - Thin support remains a complete lawful form

Many cases need one support view but not one atlas-form support package.

Stay with one thinner support view when:

- the current reading needs only one declared source surface or one derived view over it;
- the current question does not need several typed set views assembled at once;
- one explicit support sentence is enough to keep the current line readable;
- or the case does not genuinely depend on metrics, transitions, or bridge-loss notes.

This matters because the support layer should stay proportionate to the burden. If a thin interpretive view already solves the reader's problem, forcing atlas form would over-type the line and create fake necessity.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.7 - Atlas form is stronger support and needs a complete record

Use `CrossSurfaceAtlasView` for the stronger support cases:

- when several typed set views over one declared source surface or one active derived set surface must be read together;
- when one atlas-form reading helps the reader inspect cross-level structure, cross-space structure, support plurality, or mapping plurality;
- when the current interpretation genuinely depends on one declared map, metric, transition support, or distortion note and those supports must stay visible together with the active source/set surfaces they qualify.

The minimal admissible atlas-support record therefore contains:

- the cited base substrate or source/set-surface entry point;
- the active source surface and any active set surface drawn from it;
- `TypedSetViews` when several declared set views are being held together;
- any cited `SearchSpaceRef`, `OutcomeSpaceRef`, or other declared space refs that the atlas reading depends on;
- any cited `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, or `BridgeDistortionNote` that materially disciplines the reading;
- `DerivedViewKind` and `BasePaletteRef` whenever the atlas reading is over one derived palette or tradition view;
- one explicit reason thin support is insufficient.

If atlas form cannot state that composite record without invention, stay with thin support or reroute to the pattern that owns the missing burden.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.8 - No autonomous local view law is introduced here

Read the docking to `A.6.3` / `E.17.0` strictly:

- the support view preserves the described object already carried by the base line;
- it does not silently mint new intensional commitments about that same object;
- it does not replace one viewpoint bundle or one publication-view family with one new local invention;
- and it does not collapse viewpoint, view, and surface into one word.

If a case would need a different object of talk, a different generic view law, or one new viewpoint family, this pattern is no longer the right route.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.9 - Support qualifiers stay support-only

`OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionSupportRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote` are admitted here only as support qualifiers.

They are declared first on the substrate side. This pattern may foreground or organize them for the reader, but it may not silently strengthen, weaken, or otherwise change the base substrate posture.

Use them when the current support view genuinely needs them:

- `OutcomeMapRef` when the current reading must show how one declared source or set surface bears on one outcome surface;
- `SpaceMetricRef` when neighborhood, spread, reachability, or crowding claims are load-bearing in the current reading;
- `TransitionSupportRef` when the current reading depends on explicit transition or level-shift support;
- `BridgeDistortionNote` when the reader must keep one declared loss or distortion visible near the current reading.

If the support view would newly introduce `lossy-bridge`, `uncertainty-bearing`, `transition-dependent`, `learned/adaptive`, or another materially different posture that the substrate did not already declare, reopen the substrate declaration instead of treating that posture change as view-only convenience.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.10 - Publication, set-surface, and pool-policy boundaries

This pattern does not publish selected sets, declare shortlist heads, or decide which candidate lines stay live.

Keep the split explicit:

- `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` helps the reader inspect one already-declared substrate;
- `G.5` publishes selector outcomes and their source/publication metadata;
- `G.10` ships publication surfaces and pins;
- `C.19` governs live candidate-pool and frontier policy;
- `C.24` governs enactment/planning posture.

If the prose starts deciding who survives, what is published, or what is shipped, it has already left this pattern.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.11 - `G.2` keeps the tradition-facing atlas specialization

When the current support view is tradition-facing and palette-first recoverability matters, route the local specialization through `G.2`.

Read the relation this way:

- `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` states the generic support-view family and the generic stronger atlas form `CrossSurfaceAtlasView`;
- `G.2` keeps the palette-first, tradition-facing specialization `TraditionAtlasView`;
- `TraditionAtlasView` is therefore one local specialization of the stronger atlas form, not the common head of the whole support family.

This keeps the family honest in both directions:

- the common support-view family does not force `Tradition` or `Atlas` into every case;
- and the `G.2` specialization does not lose its palette-first recoverability.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.12 - Operator kit: choose, record, preserve, reroute

Use this compact kit whenever you need one support view that can actually be used, checked, and rerouted in practice.

| Decision point | What to do now | Lawful result | Stop or reroute when... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1. Which base line am I reading?` | Cite the base substrate or recoverable source/set-surface entry point. | The support view is anchored on one visible base line. | The view still floats free of the line it is supposed to help read. |
| `2. What support question is this view answering?` | State the question directly in one sentence. | The reader can tell what this view helps inspect. | The view mostly repeats theory without naming the practical inspection burden. |
| `3. Do I need thin support or atlas support?` | Choose ordinary `CrossSurfaceSupportView` unless several views, spaces, mappings, or qualifiers must be held together at once. | The support head is chosen honestly. | Atlas language appears by reflex, or thin support would already solve the reading problem. |
| `4. Which surfaces and qualifiers must stay recoverable?` | Keep the active source surface, active set surface, derived view, base palette, and cited qualifiers visible only when they truly do work. | Recoverability stays proportional to the burden. | The base palette or base surface disappears behind the strongest visible overlay. |
| `5. Is the line still support-only?` | Check whether the prose preserves the base substrate and its object of talk. | The view remains one reading, not one rewrite of the underlying line. | The prose is really changing the substrate, publishing outputs, or deciding policy. |

Use this compact support-view record when drafting or repairing the line:

```text
SupportHead               = CrossSurfaceSupportView | CrossSurfaceAtlasView
BaseSubstrateRef          = ...
SupportQuestion           = ...
ActiveSourceSurface       = ...
ActiveSetSurface?         = ...
DerivedViewKind?          = ...
BasePaletteRef?           = ...
TypedSetViews?            = ...
CitedSpaceRefs?           = ...
SupportQualifiers?        = ...
WhyThinIsEnough? /
WhyAtlasIsNeeded?         = ...
```

Run this self-check before you leave the passage:

- if the record would change the base relation or posture, reopen `A.19.SURF-SPACE`;
- if the atlas-necessity line is empty, stay with thin support;
- if the next live burden is naming repair, terminology precision, publication, or policy, reroute to `F.18`, `A.6.P`, `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24` instead of stretching support-view prose across those boundaries.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:4.13 - Using the support view with neighboring patterns

Read neighboring patterns in this order once the support-view record is in place:

- Use `G.2` when the support view becomes palette-first, tradition-facing atlas work. That is one local specialization of atlas support, not the common family head.
- Use `F.18` when the burden is label choice around support-view, atlas, palette, or map language. Naming notes may explain the labels, but they do not change the base substrate or the support question.
- Use `A.6.P` when one passage collapses view, surface, space, map, or palette into one umbrella word. Repair the layer split first, then continue.
- Use `A.0` when cold-reader glossing is what the current line lacks. Glosses help recognition; they do not replace the base support-view record.
- Use `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24` when the passage starts deciding outputs, survivor sets, or planning posture.

If a neighboring passage would change the described object or the base substrate posture, this pattern is no longer the right owner for that sentence. Reopen the base line or reroute.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:5 - Archetypal Grounding


#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:5.1 - System

**Tell.** One QD line already has one declared archive-side substrate. Readers still need one ordinary support reading that keeps local archive neighborhoods readable, but no shortlist, atlas bundle, or shipping result exists yet.

**Show.** The active support head is ordinary `CrossSurfaceSupportView`. It reads one declared archive-side substrate line whose active source surface remains `Archive` and whose active space burden remains recoverable through `BehaviorCharacteristicSpace@ed=12`. The only extra support kept visible here is `ArchiveNeighborhoodMetric@ed=4`, because the current question is simply how local archive neighborhoods shape the reader's interpretation of the already-declared line.

**Cash-out.** This is one thinner support view over one already-declared substrate. It keeps one source surface and one support question in view without introducing several `TypedSetViews`, one outcome map, one transition-support object, or one bridge-loss note. Downstream interpretation gets the extra legibility without accidentally turning the metric note into ontology.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:5.2 - Episteme

**Tell.** One synthesis line already keeps a base SoTA palette and one derived tradition-facing reading. The reader now needs one stronger atlas-form support view that keeps the base palette recoverable while showing how several tradition-facing views and cross-level notes sit together.

**Show.** The active support head is `CrossSurfaceAtlasView`. It reads one declared palette-facing substrate line whose source-surface family remains `TraditionPalette`, whose active derived view remains `TraditionFront`, and whose base palette remains recoverable through `SoTAPaletteDescriptionId`. The cited spaces stay explicit as `TraditionComparisonSpace@ed=3` and `AdoptionOutcomeSpace@ed=2`. The atlas reading keeps together the declared set views `TraditionFront` and `TraditionArchive`, the mapping `PaletteToAdoptionOutcomeMap@ed=1`, the distortion note `CrossTraditionComparisonLossNote@ed=1`, and the local `G.2` specialization `TraditionAtlasView`.

**Cash-out.** Here the stronger atlas form is honest because several declared views, spaces, and qualifiers really must stay visible together. Even so, it still does not redefine the base palette. The reader can recover the palette, the active derived set surface, the cited spaces, the outcome map, the support note, and the local specialization together.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:5.3 - Boundary anti-case

**Tell.** One note starts from "atlas view" language, then quietly changes the base outcome posture and argues that only one shortlisted tradition should remain live.

**Show.** This is not a support view anymore. It is mixing substrate repair with candidate-pool or publication policy.

**Cash-out.** Reopen the substrate if the base relation or posture changed. Route retention or shipping decisions to `C.19`, `C.24`, `G.5`, or `G.10` instead of using support-view prose to smuggle them in.

#### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:5.4 - Use-situation spread

Use the support-view family this way across different working situations:

| Working situation | Choose | What must stay explicit | Common miss avoided |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Archive-side QD line that only needs one metric cue so the reader can see local neighborhoods | Thin support | One base substrate, one support question, one active source surface, and the specific metric qualifier doing work. | Forcing atlas form into a case that only needs one simple reading aid. |

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:6 - Bias-Annotation


- **Gov bias.** The pattern prefers explicit reuse of existing view law over local convenience talk about one `view`.
- **Arch bias.** The pattern keeps substrate, support reading, publication, and policy separated even when one merged story would sound simpler.
- **Prag bias.** The pattern prefers thinner support views by default and treats atlas form as one stronger option rather than a universal baseline.
- **Did bias.** The pattern insists on recoverability of the base palette or base source surface because readers otherwise over-trust the strongest visible support form.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:7 - Conformance Checklist

Treat a line as conforming only if every gate below passes.

| ID | Gate question | Fail when | Repair or reroute |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CC-A19SV-1` | Is one already-declared base substrate or source/set-surface entry point named explicitly? | The support view floats free of the line it is supposed to help read. | Cite the base substrate or the recoverable source/set-surface entry point. |
| `CC-A19SV-2` | Is the support view explicitly docked to existing `A.6.3` / `E.17.0` law? | The text presents itself as one autonomous local theory of views. | State the docking explicitly or reroute to the owner that really defines the missing view law. |
| `CC-A19SV-3` | Does the line preserve the same described object and keep the base substrate as semantic center? | The support prose retargets the object of talk or repairs the substrate in place. | Reopen under `A.19.SURF-SPACE`, `A.6.4`, or the appropriate neighboring owner. |
| `CC-A19SV-4` | Are the current source surface, any active set surface, and any active derived view or base palette recoverable? | The support reading hides the base palette, base surface, or active derived set surface behind one stronger visible overlay. | Restore the missing recoverability fields. |
| `CC-A19SV-5` | Is the active profile chosen honestly: thin support or atlas support? | Atlas language is used by reflex, or the line needs atlas support but never says so. | State the profile explicitly and justify why thin support is or is not sufficient. |
| `CC-A19SV-6` | If atlas form is active, is the composite atlas-support record complete? | Several views, spaces, mappings, or qualifiers are being used, but `TypedSetViews`, cited spaces, mappings, qualifiers, or the reason thin support is insufficient remain hidden. | Publish the missing atlas-support record or step back to thin support. |
| `CC-A19SV-7` | Are support qualifiers really support-only and reused from the substrate side? | Metrics, transitions, maps, or distortion notes silently change the base relation or posture, or become mandatory core everywhere. | Keep them as foregrounded qualifiers only, or reopen the substrate declaration. |
| `CC-A19SV-8` | If `TraditionAtlasView` is used, is it kept as one `G.2` specialization rather than the common family head? | The local specialization is treated as if every support case were already palette-first atlas work. | Restore the split between `CrossSurfaceAtlasView` and `TraditionAtlasView`. |
| `CC-A19SV-9` | Does the line stay out of publication and policy work? | The prose starts deciding who survives, what is published, or what is shipped. | Split the line and route those burdens to `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24`. |
| `CC-A19SV-10` | Could a cold reader choose thin support versus atlas support and fill one support-view record without hidden invention? | The reader still needs surrounding memo knowledge to know which head to use, what fields matter, or why atlas is or is not needed. | Fill the compact record from `4.12` and state why thin support is enough or why atlas support is necessary. |
| `CC-A19SV-11` | Is the support question explicit enough to tell the reader what this view helps inspect now? | The view mostly restates the base theory, but the practical inspection burden stays unnamed. | State the support question directly and keep the base line recoverable beside it. |
| `CC-A19SV-12` | When specialization, naming repair, publication, or policy becomes the next burden, is the reroute explicit? | The support prose silently drifts into `G.2`, `F.18`, `A.6.P`, `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, or `C.24` without naming the boundary. | Split the line and cite the owning neighbor instead of stretching support-view prose across that boundary. |

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them


| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Writing as if `A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` were a fresh autonomous theory of views | It duplicates existing `A.6.3` / `E.17.0` law and collapses viewpoint/view/surface discipline. | State the docking to existing view law explicitly. |
| Letting atlas language become the default meaning of every support case | The strongest visible support form silently becomes the family head. | Keep ordinary thinner support views lawful and say when atlas form is actually needed. |
| Treating support pins as the view's semantic center | Metrics, transitions, or distortion notes then replace the base substrate. | Keep the base substrate and support question explicit, and keep support pins optional. |
| Letting a derived tradition view replace its base palette | The reader loses palette-first recoverability and mistakes one local interpretation for the default ontology. | Keep `DerivedViewKind` and `BasePaletteRef` visible together. |
| Turning the support view into publication or pool policy | The reader can no longer tell whether the text is helping interpret the line or deciding what survives and gets published. | Keep `G.5`, `G.10`, `C.19`, and `C.24` outside this pattern. |
| Forcing atlas form into every first reading | Simple cases become over-typed and harder to use. | Start with the thinner support-view form and widen only when the current need genuinely requires it. |

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

- Readers get one explicit support layer without losing the declared substrate.
- FPF keeps one common support-view family without forcing `G.2` or another local specialization to carry the whole burden.
- Atlas-form support remains available where it helps, but thinner support views stay lawful.

**Trade-offs**

- The declaration must keep more boundaries explicit: view law, substrate, publication, and policy no longer collapse into one comfortable narrative.
- Some cases that once looked like "just a view" must now say whether they are thin support, atlas support, publication, or policy.
- The pattern requires the base palette or source surface to stay recoverable, which can make local prose slightly less terse.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:10 - Rationale

The family needs one common support-view pattern because neither of the earlier extremes is good enough.

If everything stays in the substrate, the substrate starts carrying interpretive and atlas-form burdens that are not part of its semantic center.

If everything stays inside one local specialization such as `G.2`, the common support burden gets trapped inside one tradition-facing case and starts looking like a local accident rather than a reusable family.

`A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW` is the middle answer:

- it keeps the support layer generic and reusable;
- it keeps the layer explicitly under existing view law;
- it lets ordinary thinner support views remain first-class;
- and it reserves stronger atlas form for the cases that truly need it.

That is why `CrossSurfaceAtlasView` appears here as one stronger support specialization, while `TraditionAtlasView` remains one `G.2` specialization of it rather than the common head.

### A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice line | Primary accepted basis | Pressure disciplined here | Practical safeguard bought | Adoption stance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Support readings should remain describedEntity-preserving views rather than becoming fresh semantic centers. | `A.6.3` and `E.17.0` already require views to preserve the described entity and not silently add new intensional commitments. | `SV-0`, `SV-1`, `SV-8`, `CC-A19SV-2`, `CC-A19SV-3`. | Keeps support prose from quietly turning into retargeting or new view-law invention. | **Adopt.** Reuse the existing view law directly rather than minting one local alternative. |
| Palette-first SoTA synthesis already treats atlas support as optional neighboring support rather than the default meaning of `Tradition` or `SoTAPaletteDescription`. | `G.2:4.7` already keeps `TraditionAtlasView` as optional neighboring support and preserves palette-first recoverability. | `SV-5`, `SV-6`, `SV-7`, `CC-A19SV-5`, `CC-A19SV-8`, worked slice `5.2`. | Keeps atlas form available without letting the strongest visible support layer replace the base palette or family head. | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt palette-first recoverability and adapt it into one reusable common support family. |
| Contemporary QD / manifold / atlas practice uses both lighter projection-style support and stronger atlas/geometry support, while heavier metrics and transition models remain case-dependent rather than universally mandatory. | Current atlas/manifold/QD practice treats heavier map, metric, and transition apparatus as optional discipline tied to the case rather than as mandatory baseline machinery. | `SV-4`, `SV-5`, `SV-6`, `CC-A19SV-5`, `CC-A19SV-6`, `CC-A19SV-7`. | Keeps thinner support lawful, keeps atlas support reusable but non-default, and prevents heavy formal support from being smuggled in by default. | **Adapt.** Keep the stronger formal support available without pretending it is the baseline for every support reading. |
