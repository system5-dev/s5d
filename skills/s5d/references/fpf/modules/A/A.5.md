## A.5 - Open‑Ended Kernel & Extension Layering

**Status.** Transitional stub (informative). This section defines no dedicated “module” subsystem. Enforceable boundary discipline lives in **A.6.0 `U.Signature`** and **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`**, with guard‑rails in **E.5.3** (Unidirectional Dependency) and **E.10** (LEX‑BUNDLE stratification).

### A.5:1 - Problem frame

FPF’s ambition is to act as an *“operating system for thought.”*
That ambition can only be realised if the framework:

* **(i)** remains *stable* and *self‑consistent* over multi‑decade timespans;
* **(ii)** *invites*, rather than resists, the continual influx of new disciplinary knowledge; and
* **(iii)** allows multiple, even competing, explanatory lenses to coexist without forcing a “winner‑takes‑all” unification.

Historically, grand “total” ontologies—Aristotle’s *Categories*, Carnap’s *Logical Construction of the World*, Bunge’s *TOE*—failed precisely because each tried to embed every domain’s primitives directly into a single monolith.  Once the monolith cracked under domain pressure, the whole edifice became unmaintainable.

### A.5:2 - Problem

If FPF were to let **domain‑specific primitives creep into its Kernel**, two pathologies would follow:

| Pathology               | Manifestation                                                                                                                  | Breach of Constitution                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kernel Bloat**        | Every new field (e.g. synthetic biology) adds bespoke `U.Type`s → Core size explodes, review surface becomes unscalable.       | Violates **C‑5 Ontological Parsimony**; erodes **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**. |
| **Conceptual Gridlock** | Conflicting axioms (deterministic thermodynamics vs. indeterministic econ‑metrics) must fight for space in the same namespace. | Breaks **C‑3 Cross‑Scale Consistency**; triggers chronic DRR deadlock.     |

A *minimal, extensible* design is therefore mandatory.

### A.5:3 - Forces

| Force                            | Tension                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stability vs. Evolvability**   | Immutable core needed for trust ↔ constant domain innovation needed for relevance.                                       |
| **Universality vs. Specificity** | Single kernel language ↔ rich idioms for fields as diverse as robotics, jurisprudence, metabolomics.                     |
| **Parsimony vs. Coverage**       | Few primitives keep reasoning elegant ↔ framework must still model energy budgets, epistemic uncertainty, agentic goals. |

### A.5:4 - Solution

FPF’s modularity is **declarative**, not “callable”: pattern texts publish **law‑governed declarations** (vocabulary + laws + applicability) that can be reused and specialised. They are not subroutines, services, or protocol endpoints in the software‑architecture sense; treat “module” as a metaphor at most.

To keep the Kernel open‑ended without a bespoke plug‑in patterns standard, FPF relies on the boundary stack that already exists elsewhere in Part A/E/F:

1. **Kernel minimality (C‑5).** Domain knowledge (physics, biology, economics, …) stays outside the Kernel by default; it enters as extension vocabularies and laws.
2. **Boundary packaging via `U.Signature` (A.6.0).** Reusable bundles are published as signatures with an explicit `SignatureManifest` (`imports`, `provides`).
3. **Dependency vs specialisation are separate relations.** `imports` forms a dependency DAG constrained by **E.5.3**; refinement/extension (`⊑`, `⊑⁺`) is expressed separately (e.g., **A.6.1 `U.MechMorph`**) and should not be conflated with `imports`.
4. **Registry references stay references.** Bridges, policy‑ids, and edition‑ids (Part F) are registry identifiers: they are cited/pinned where needed, not treated as exported symbols in `provides`.

This section is intentionally lightweight: it provides architectural intent and routing pointers only. Any new enforceable modularity constraints belong in the A.6.* boundary patterns (or in E.* guard‑rails), not here.
