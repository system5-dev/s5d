## A.6.5 -  U.RelationSlotDiscipline - SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind discipline for n‑ary relations (with slot‑operation lexicon)

**Plain‑name.** Relation slot discipline.

**Status.** Normative (Core).
**Placement.** Part A, cluster A.IV “Signature Stack & Boundary Discipline”; directly under A.6.0 `U.Signature` and alongside A.6.1–A.6.4.
**Depends on.**
– A.1 `U.Holon` (holonic carrier model).
– A.6.0 `U.Signature` (universal morphism/relationship signatures).
– A.7 (Strict Distinction; I/D/S vs Surface).
– E.8 (pattern authoring order & SoTA discipline).
– E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE: Tech/Plain registers, naming guards).

**Coordinates with.**
– C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` (episteme slots: DescribedEntity, GroundingHolon, ClaimGraph, Viewpoint, View, ReferenceScheme).
– C.3.* Kind‑CAL (Kinds, KindSignature, KindBridge).
– F.18 (name governance; twin‑register discipline).

### A.6.5:1 - Problem frame

FPF relies heavily on **n‑ary relations and morphisms**:

* episteme component layouts (`U.EpistemeKind` in C.2.1),
* role enactment and assignment,
* method/service signatures,
* guards and bridges in Part B/C,
* publication and view operators in Part E, and any other `U.Signature` whose **Vocabulary** row declares n‑ary relations or operators across Part A/B/C/E.

In practice, existing episteme and drafts **frequently conflate**:

1. the **place/position** in a signatured structure (relation/operator/record/port bundle; e.g. “the 2nd argument, named Subject”),
2. the **kind of value** that may fill that position (`U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, …), and
3. the **reference/identifier** we actually store there (`…Id`, `…Ref`).

This produces subtle bugs (elaborated in A.6.5:2):

* misuse of “Subject/Object” as SlotKind‑like names for very different ValueKinds (explicitly banned for episteme Tech names by E.10),
* the `…Ref` suffix attached to both conceptual values and reference fields, erasing ValueKind vs RefKind,
* mixed reasoning about “role”, “slot”, and “filler” as if they were the same layer,
* fragile substitution questions (“can I plug this module here?”) that depend on informal judgement rather than SlotSpec laws.

A second, subtler conflation appears in prose: authors mix **binding / initialization / assignment / substitution / retargeting / mutation / passing** as if they were synonyms for “put something in a slot”. This blurs the intended discipline precisely in the places where FPF must be crisp (signatures, morphisms, bridges, and viewing operators).

`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` pins a **single, reusable discipline** over `U.Signature` so that **every position in an n‑ary signature** is described with:

* a **SlotKind** — *where* in the signature,
* a **ValueKind** — *what sort of thing* may fill that place, and
* a **RefKind** — *how we point at it* in episteme (identifier / handle), if at all,

**and** it standardises the **lexicon for operations over slots** so that extension texts can describe “early vs late binding”, “retargeting”, and “by‑value edits” without collapsing layers.

This pattern makes slot discipline explicit and shareable across **epistemes, roles, methods, services, bridges, guards, and all other `U.Signature`d calculi**: any “parameter list”, “port list”, “field set”, or “coordinate tuple” for an n‑ary signature in FPF **is** a set of SlotSpecs governed by this discipline.

### A.6.5:2 - Problem (symptoms in FPF)

Typical failure modes the pattern is designed to eliminate:

1. **Slot vs value vs ref confusion.**
   Episteme fields such as `DescribedEntityRef` are sometimes treated as:

   * the **slot** (“the described entity position”),
   * the **value kind** (“the described entity type”), and
   * a **reference field** (“this is the pointer we store”).

   Reasoning about substitution (“can I swap one described entity for another?”) then mixes three levels at once.

2. **Kernel types misused as slot names.**
   Kernel concepts like `U.Entity` or `U.Holon` are used directly as slot names (“the `U.Entity` of this episteme”), hiding the difference between:

   * the abstract **Kind** (`U.Entity` as intensional universe), and
   * the **place** where one such entity is used in a particular relation.

3. **“Role” overloaded as slot.**
   In relation signatures and structural calculi, “role” has crept in as a synonym for “argument position”: “the role of the subject”, “the role of the provider”. This clashes with `U.Role` in RoleEnactment and makes it hard to distinguish:

   * **holonic role** (mask worn by a system), from
   * **slot** (position in a relation).

4. **Ref‑suffix drift.**
   In the absence of a discipline, the suffix `…Ref` is attached to:

   * entity kinds (`U.EntityRef` interpreted as “the entity itself”),
   * episteme fields (`describedEntityRef`),
   * sometimes even to slots (“DescribedEntityRefSlot”).

   That makes it impossible to read signatures and know whether we talk about:

   * a **conceptual value** (by‑value), or
   * a **reference/identifier** (by‑reference via a handle).

5. **Substitution rules not localisable.**
   When the slot/value/ref layers are not separated:

   * we cannot state “you may substitute **any instance of ValueKind V** in Slot S”, nor
   * “this Bridge only changes RefKind, not ValueKind”.

   This blocks clean use of A.6.0 `U.Signature` as a shared calculus for method/role/episteme signatures.

6. **Episteme‑specific slots not standardised.**
   For epistemes, the positions “what is this about?”, “in which holon is it grounded?”, “what ClaimGraph is inside?” re‑appear across patterns. Without a shared slot discipline, each pattern names these ad‑hoc, breaking the ability to state **universal laws** over episteme morphisms (A.6.2–A.6.4).

7. **Operation‑lexicon drift (slot filling spoken as one verb).**
   Extension prose introduces ad‑hoc words for “put something in a slot” and then imports unintended semantics. The most common mistakes are:

   * using a single word (e.g. “fill”, “set”, “occupy”, “attach”) to cover **initialization**, **assignment**, **retargeting**, and **by‑value editing**;
   * using person/role metaphors for slot content (“occupant”) that re‑introduce the “role ≈ slot” confusion;
   * describing “early vs late binding” without stating **which link** is early/late (name→slot binding vs slot→content filling vs ref→referent resolution).

The result: **local convenience, global incoherence** — exactly what A.6.0 and E.10 are supposed to prevent.

### A.6.5:3 - Forces

* **F1 - Simplicity vs expressiveness.**
  Engineers need a **small number of concepts** they can hold in mind while reading a signature; yet we must express:

  * where a parameter sits,
  * which kinds it can take,
  * whether it’s by value/by reference,
  * how substitution behaves,
  * and (in prose) what kind of slot‑operation is being described.

* **F2 - Cross‑disciplinary reuse.**
  Slot discipline must work for:

  * logical relations (KD‑CAL, LOG‑CAL),
  * episteme structures (C.2.1),
  * systems/roles/methods (A/B),
  * services and APIs (including method/service interfaces and ports),
  * cells in tables and databases,
  * guards, bridges, and flows in E.TGA,
  * and publication operations (E.17).

  A scheme that is too domain‑specific (e.g. “database attributes only”) won’t scale; the same discipline must underlie **all** `U.Signature`d argument/port lists.

* **F3 - Alignment with existing tooling.**
  Tooling stacks already operate with:

  * typed parameters and records,
  * identifiers vs values vs references,
  * and (in modern typed settings) explicit distinctions between *binding*, *store update*, and *mutation*.

  FPF must line up with this practice enough that signatures can be implemented without inventing a parallel type system.

* **F4 - I/D/S discipline.**
  Strict distinction (A.7, E.10.D2) already separates **intensional objects**, their **descriptions**, and **specifications**. The same discipline is needed inside relations:

  * slot ≠ value ≠ reference,
  * system role ≠ slot name,
  * describedEntity ≠ guard,
  * and “change the reference” ≠ “change the thing referred to”.

* **F5 - Didactic primacy and naming discipline.**
  E.8 and E.10 demand patterns that are:

  * teachable (Tell‑Show‑Show examples, explicit biases),
  * lexically guarded (Tech/Plain split, explicit head‑nouns).

  Slot discipline must integrate seamlessly with that.

* **F6 - Binding‑time talk must be unambiguous.**
  “Early binding / late binding” is meaningful only if the author states **what is being fixed when**. FPF needs a canonical way to speak about:

  * early/late **slot filling**,
  * early/late **reference resolution / dispatch**,
  * and (where a language surface is in play) early/late **name binding**.

### A.6.5:4 - Solution — SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind triple (plus a slot‑operation lexicon)

#### A.6.5:4.1 - Three layers for every argument position

`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` extends `U.Signature` with a **three‑layer description** for every argument position (whether we call it “parameter”, “slot”, “coordinate”, or “port” in colloquial prose).
In **normative** text, the canonical word is **slot**, and the canonical carrier is a **SlotSpec** triple (A.6.0).

1. **SlotKind (place in signature).**
   *How this position is denoted in the Signature and what is fixed about it by the signature’s definition.*
   – Examples: `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ServiceEndpointSlot`, `CallerHolonSlot`, `MetricSlot`.
   – SlotKind is **structural**: it picks out **one distinguished place** in the argument/port/field list of a given relation, operator, record, or other signatured bundle; it does **not** name a “role” played by whatever fills the slot.
   – For an n‑ary relation/operator declared in a `U.Signature`, the pair *(Signature id, SlotKind)* identifies a **slot**; positional indices are merely a presentation‑level enumeration of these slots.
   – What a filler “does” in that place (its contribution to laws, constraints, effects) is governed by the **laws over the Signature** and by the corresponding ValueKind, not by SlotKind‑as‑“role”.

2. **ValueKind (kind of slot filler).**
   *Which kinds of things may fill this position in principle (at the intensional level).*
   – Examples: `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, `U.Method`, `U.Episteme`, `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.Viewpoint`, `U.Characteristic`, `U.ReferenceScheme`.
   – ValueKind is a **Kind** (C.3.\*) or another kernel‑level type; it is **not** a slot and never carries `*Slot`/`*Ref` suffixes.

3. **RefKind (how we store / refer).**
   *What reference/identifier we actually store in episteme when we fill this slot.*
   – Examples: `U.EntityRef`, `U.HolonRef`, `U.MethodRef`, `U.EpistemeRef`, `U.ViewpointRef`, `U.SurfaceRef`, (optionally) `U.ClaimGraphRef` if a Context chooses to reference claim graphs rather than store them by value.
   – RefKind is **about references, not values**; it usually points to an editioned artifact (A.7, F.15) and carries the `.edition` field when pinning a phase.

**Discipline:**

* Each declared argument position in a `U.Signature` **MUST** be described by:

  * a SlotKind (name and documentation),
  * a ValueKind (type of permissible fillers),
  * and either a RefKind or an explicit declaration “**by‑value**” (no RefKind; the value is embedded).
* SlotKind and ValueKind are **intensional**; RefKind is **representational**. This mirrors I/D/S: *slot* describes structure, *value* describes what can sit there, *ref* describes how we point to concrete instances.

#### A.6.5:4.2 - Naming discipline: `*Slot` and `*Ref`

This pattern introduces the following **lexical constraints**, aligned with E.10:

1. **`*Slot` reserved for SlotKind.**

   * Any Tech name ending with `…Slot` **MUST** denote a SlotKind: a named place in a relation/morphism signature.
   * Examples:
     – `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`.
   * `*Slot` **MUST NOT** appear in names of:
     – ValueKind (e.g. `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, `U.Method`),
     – RefKind (e.g. `U.EntityRef`),
     – concrete episteme fields (they may be named e.g. `describedEntityRef`, but not `describedEntitySlotField`).

2. **`*Ref` reserved for RefKind and reference fields.**

   * Any Tech name ending with `…Ref` **MUST** denote either:
     – a **RefKind** (type of references/identifiers), or
     – a **field** whose type is a RefKind (`describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef`).
   * `*Ref` **MUST NOT** appear in names of:
     – ValueKinds (e.g. `U.EntityRef` **cannot** mean “an entity”; it is a reference type),
     – SlotKinds,
     – Kinds themselves (`U.Kind`, `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`).

3. **ValueKind names carry no `*Slot`/`*Ref`.**

   * ValueKinds are named using standard FPF conventions (A/E/F, E.10), without `*Slot`/`*Ref`.
   * Examples: `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, `U.Method`, `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.ReferenceScheme`, `U.Viewpoint`, `U.View`.

4. **No “Role” as SlotKind head.**

   * In the context of relation signatures, **do not** use “Role” as the head noun for SlotKinds (to avoid conflict with `U.Role`).
   * Use “Slot” or a neutral description: e.g. `EnactorHolonSlot` (ValueKind `U.Holon`) rather than `EnactorRoleSlot`.

These rules become part of the **LEX‑BUNDLE guards** and are enforced by F.18 / name‑acceptance harnesses.

#### A.6.5:4.3 - Integration with `U.Signature` (A.6.0)

`U.Signature` already provides a generic pattern for declaring morphism/relationship signatures (SubjectKind, BaseType, Quantification, ResultKind, Vocabulary, Laws).

`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` refines this by adding a **SlotSpec** layer:

*For each parameter position `i` in a signature*:

```
SlotSpec_i = ⟨name: SlotKind, value: ValueKind, refMode: {ByValue | RefKind}⟩
```

* **SlotKind** — Tech name with `*Slot` suffix, plus documentation.
* **ValueKind** — a `U.Type` (often a `U.Kind` or kernel type) declaring the intensional universe of admissible fillers.
* **refMode**:

  * `ByValue` — the actual value of ValueKind is embedded (typical for small structured values like `U.ClaimGraph` inside an episteme card).
  * `RefKind` — a **type** of references/identifiers for that ValueKind; e.g. `U.EntityRef` for `U.Entity`, `U.HolonRef` for `U.Holon`. Substitution then operates on references, not directly on the underlying values.

In practice, a `U.Signature` that follows this pattern:

* becomes **self‑documenting**: each parameter has a clear “slot vs value vs ref” story;
* supports **typed substitution**: replacing content within the same SlotKind requires only ValueKind compatibility;
* aligns with **tool signatures** in implementation languages (row‑typed records, dependently typed parameters, effect‑typed arguments). ([13])

#### A.6.5:4.4 - Typed substitution discipline

Given a relation or morphism `R` with signature Σ and SlotSpecs `{SlotSpec_i}`:

* A **substitution** at slot `i` is a change of the **slot content** that fills SlotKind_i, within or across episteme entries.
* `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` enforces:

1. **SlotKind invariance.**
   A substitution **never** changes SlotKind — only the slot content (Value/Ref).
   – “We put a different dataset into the `DatasetSlot`.”
   – “We switch the grounding holon in `GroundingHolonSlot`.”

2. **ValueKind compatibility.**
   The new content **MUST** be of the same ValueKind (or a declared subkind) as `SlotSpec_i.value`; Kind‑CAL governs this (`⊑` in C.3.1–C.3.2). If a Context uses EoIClass species constraints (C.3.2), those act as additional guards but do **not** change the SlotKind.

3. **RefKind correctness.**
   If `refMode=RefKind`, the stored field is of that RefKind; substitutions operate on references, not on underlying values. Edition pinning is handled as usual by `.edition` fields in F‑patterns (F.15, etc.).

4. **By‑value vs by‑ref awareness.**
   Substitutions at by‑value slots (e.g. `ClaimGraphSlot`) are **content edits** to the episteme or relation instance; they may affect formality F or assurance lanes. Substitutions at ref slots are **retargetings** of describedEntity or context, and their legality is governed by A.6.2–A.6.4 and Bridge/CL rules. Tooling SHOULD surface this difference explicitly in authoring surfaces (e.g. separate “Ref” vs “embedded content” columns).

These rules give a uniform way to say:

> “You may swap component X with Y in this slot, because they share ValueKind and pass the relevant Kind/Bridge constraints.”

#### A.6.5:4.5 - Slot operation lexicon (binding / filling / assignment / retargeting / mutation)

This subsection standardises **how Core and extensions talk about operations over slots**, without committing FPF to any particular programming language semantics. It is a *lexical* and *didactic* guardrail that preserves the SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind stratification in prose.

##### A.6.5:4.5.1 - Four‑way separation: Identifier vs Slot vs Slot‑content vs Referent

*Diagram is illustrative; the term distinctions are normative.*

To avoid conflating “binding / assignment / passing / mutation”, FPF authors SHALL keep the following separation in mind:

```
(1) Identifier/Name  ──binds-to──>  (2) SlotKind  ──in an instance──>  (2′) Slot‑instance  ──filled-with──>  (3) Slot‑content (Value | Ref)
                                                              └─(if Ref) resolves-to──> (4) Referent value / artifact
```

**Normative terms**:

* **Identifier** (Surface): a name used in a syntax, table column, record field, port label, or parameter label.
* **SlotKind** (I‑plane): the signature‑level label for a distinguished place in a relation.
* **Slot‑instance** (S‑plane / representation): the actual location/cell/position corresponding to a SlotKind inside a specific relation instance, record, port bundle, or episteme card.
* **Slot‑content** (representation): what is stored in a slot‑instance. It is either:

  * a **by‑value value** of ValueKind, or
  * a **reference handle** of RefKind.
* **Referent**: the intensional thing the RefKind points to when resolved (often an editioned artifact).

This separation is the anchor for all “binding time” talk in A.6.5:4.6.

##### A.6.5:4.5.2 - Canonical verbs (Tech register) for slot operations *(normative)*

When a pattern, bridge, or operator description discusses a change or action “with respect to a slot”, it SHALL use (or explicitly map to) the following verbs. Each verb is tied to **which link/layer it affects**.

1. **bind / rebind** (Identifier → SlotKind/slot‑instance).
   *Use when the subject is an Identifier/Name and the effect is changing what that name designates.*
   – **bind**: establish a new association of an Identifier to a SlotKind/slot‑instance (or to a value in a language surface).
   – **rebind**: change an existing association of an Identifier to designate a different slot‑instance or different value.
   **Guard:** do not use “bind” to mean “write into a slot”. Binding is about *names*, not slots.

2. **fill** (Slot‑instance ← Slot‑content).
   *The generic, cross‑domain verb meaning “provide slot‑content for a slot‑instance”.*
   – Fill does **not** by itself imply first‑time vs update, nor by‑value vs by‑ref.
   – Use **fill** when discussing hardware slots, tuple coordinates, ports, record fields, or parameters uniformly.

3. **initialize** (first fill).
   *Use when the slot‑instance previously had no content.*
   – For `refMode=RefKind`: initialization sets the initial reference handle.
   – For `ByValue`: initialization sets the embedded initial value.
   **Guard:** do not call initialization “assignment” in normative text.

4. **assign / set / write / update** (subsequent fill; slot‑content replacement).
   *Use when a slot‑instance already has content and you replace it with new content.*
   – These verbs are allowed as near‑synonyms, but **SHOULD** be used consistently within one pattern family.
   **Guard:** when `refMode=RefKind`, prefer **retarget** (below) if the intent is “change what this ref points to”, not “edit content”.

5. **retarget** (Ref slot update, same SlotKind/ValueKind).
   *Use only for `refMode=RefKind` slots, when the operation replaces one reference handle with another, thereby changing the referent while preserving SlotKind and ValueKind.*
   – “Retarget `DescribedEntitySlot` from `UserService#staging` to `UserService#prod`.”
   Retargeting is the canonical FPF verb for “swap the referenced thing in this slot”.

6. **substitute** (typed replacement with explicit compatibility claim).
   *Use when the statement’s main point is the **compatibility law** (“allowed because ValueKind matches”).*
   – Substitute is a **discipline word**: it signals that SlotKind is fixed and ValueKind compatibility is being asserted/checked.

7. **resolve / dereference** (Ref → Referent).
   *Use when a reference handle is mapped to the intensional referent.*
   – This is where “late binding” often hides in runtime systems (dispatch, dynamic lookup, registry indirection).
   **Guard:** resolving a reference is distinct from retargeting the reference.

8. **mutate / modify** (Referent internal change; content unchanged).
   *Use only when the referent itself changes while the slot‑content (the reference handle) does not.*
   **FPF note:** In edition‑disciplined contexts, prefer to describe intentional change as **revise / re‑edition** + **retarget**, rather than “mutate”, because the Core treats editioned artifacts as stable per edition (A.7, F.15).

9. **pass** (parameter slot filling).
   *Use for method/service signatures when an argument fills a parameter slot at a call boundary.*
   – Passing is a specialised instance of **fill**, typically realised as parameter binding + slot filling in implementation languages. In FPF text, “pass into SlotKind” is acceptable if SlotKind names the parameter position.

##### A.6.5:4.5.3 - Canonical nouns *(normative)*

To prevent role metaphors from re‑entering slot talk:

* Use **slot‑content** (preferred) or **slot filler** for “the thing currently in the slot”.
* Avoid person/role metaphors such as **occupant** in normative writing. If a Context insists on using such a word in Plain register, it SHALL define it explicitly as a synonym for slot‑content and SHALL NOT derive role semantics from it.
* Use **target**/**referent** for what a Ref points to; use **retargeting** for changing the target by changing the Ref.
* Use **by‑value edit** (or **embedded content edit**) for changes to a `ByValue` slot such as `ClaimGraphSlot`.

##### A.6.5:4.5.4 - Operator naming guidance for slot‑writing operators *(normative, but intentionally lightweight)*

When naming an operator/morphism/bridge whose primary effect is a slot change, the Tech name SHOULD make two things legible:

1. **Which SlotKind(s) it writes**, and
2. **Which operation class it is**, using the canonical verbs above.

Recommended patterns (examples only; Contexts may adopt their own naming style via F.18):

* `Retarget<SlotQualifier>` for ref‑slot retargeting (e.g. `RetargetDescribedEntity`, `RetargetGroundingHolon`).
* `Edit<SlotQualifier>` / `Update<SlotQualifier>` for by‑value content edits (e.g. `EditClaimGraph`).
* `Substitute<SlotQualifier>` when the operator exists to enforce/declare ValueKind compatibility (e.g. `SubstituteDataset`).
* `Resolve<SlotQualifier>` when the operator is about resolving a Ref to a referent (e.g. `ResolveServiceEndpoint`).

This rule is a lexical enforcement of A.6.5:4.4 (typed substitution discipline): the name should tell the reader whether the operator is a **retargeting** (ref change) or a **content edit** (by‑value change).

#### A.6.5:4.6 - Binding time and “early vs late binding” *(normative framing, informative examples)*

In cross‑domain slot talk, “early binding / late binding” is meaningful only if the author states **which link is being fixed when**. Under A.6.5:4.5, there are three distinct “times” that writers must not conflate:

1. **SlotSpec time (signature time).**
   SlotKind / ValueKind / refMode are fixed when the `U.Signature` is declared. This is “early” by definition in FPF Core.

2. **Slot filling time (initialization / assignment / retargeting).**
   A particular relation instance / episteme card / parameter bundle acquires slot‑content for a SlotKind.
   – *Early‑filled* means: chosen at authoring/spec time (e.g. configuration pins a specific `U.HolonRef`).
   – *Late‑filled* means: chosen at runtime or late in a workflow (e.g. service endpoint selected by policy at deployment).

3. **Resolution / dispatch time (resolve RefKind; select referent).**
   Even if a ref handle is present, the referent may be resolved early or late.
   – *Eager resolution* means: resolve now, cache/commit to a referent.
   – *Lazy resolution* means: resolve on demand.
   – *Dynamic dispatch* is a special case: the “method slot” is resolved at call time based on a receiver/context, rather than being statically selected.

**Rule (lexical guard):**
Any use of “early binding” / “late binding” in Core or extensions SHALL specify which of the above it refers to, using one of:

* **early/late‑filled** (slot filling),
* **eager/lazy‑resolved** (resolution),
* **early/late name‑binding** (Identifier binding, if a language surface is being discussed).

This preserves the A.6.5 stratification and prevents importing accidental semantics from a specific programming language.

### A.6.5:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell‑Show‑Show)

Following E.7, we ground the pattern in a **System** example and an **Episteme** example.

#### A.6.5:5.1 - System example — authentication pipeline signature

Consider an `AuthPipelineSpecKind` (system‑level episteme describing an authentication pipeline for a microservice). Its key slots might be:

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — “which holon the pipeline is about”
  – ValueKind: `U.Holon` (EoIClass = “UserService system”).
  – RefKind: `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `UserService#prod`).

* `AuthProviderComponentSlot` — “which authentication provider component is selected”
  – ValueKind: `U.Holon` (EoIClass = “AuthProviderSystem”).
  – RefKind: `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `Auth_OIDC`, `Auth_LDAP`).

* `ClaimGraphSlot` — “what is asserted about the pipeline”
  – ValueKind: `U.ClaimGraph`.
  – refMode: `ByValue` (ClaimGraph stored inside the episteme card).

Substitutions / retargetings:

* **Retargeting** `AuthProviderComponentSlot` from `Auth_OIDC` to `Auth_LDAP`:
  – SlotKind fixed (`AuthProviderComponentSlot`).
  – ValueKind unchanged (`U.Holon`, `AuthProviderSystem ⊑ U.Holon`).
  – RefKind unchanged (`U.HolonRef`).
  – Semantically: “retarget the ref that fills the same slot”.

* **Retargeting** `DescribedEntitySlot` from `UserService#staging` to `UserService#prod`:
  – Same SlotKind and ValueKind.
  – Different `U.HolonRef` slot‑content.
  – May require different grounding and assurance episteme, but the slot discipline is identical.

#### A.6.5:5.2 - Episteme example — model evaluation result

Consider `ModelEvaluationResultKind` as an episteme kind:

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — the model being evaluated
  – ValueKind: `U.Method` (intensional ML model).
  – RefKind: `U.MethodRef` (id of `Model_v3`).

* `DatasetSlot` — the dataset on which it is evaluated
  – ValueKind: `U.Entity` (EoIClass = “Dataset”).
  – RefKind: `U.EntityRef` (e.g. `Dataset_A`, `Dataset_B`).

* `TargetCharacteristicSlot` — the characteristic being measured
  – ValueKind: `U.Characteristic` (`Accuracy`, `F1`, `AUROC`).
  – RefKind: `U.CharacteristicRef`.

* `GroundingHolonSlot` — evaluation environment
  – ValueKind: `U.Holon` (e.g. `EvalCluster#1`).
  – RefKind: `U.HolonRef`.

* `ClaimGraphSlot` — evaluation result graph
  – ValueKind: `U.ClaimGraph`.
  – refMode: `ByValue`; the numeric thresholds and results live inside `content : U.ClaimGraph`.

Typical moves:

* `DatasetSlot`: **retarget** `Dataset_A` → `Dataset_B` to test generalisation.
* `TargetCharacteristicSlot`: **retarget** `Accuracy` → `F1` to focus on class imbalance.
* `ClaimGraphSlot`: **by‑value edit** thresholds from “`P95Latency ≤ 200 ms`” to “`≤ 150 ms`” — a `ByValue` content edit, not a ref retargeting.

The SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline makes these moves **local and explicit**: the pattern describes which moves are allowed where, and A.6.2–A.6.4 then constrain how episteme morphisms may change ClaimGraphs and references.

#### A.6.5:5.3 - Didactic micro‑examples — substitution by SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind *(informative)*

The following short examples are intended for a didactic guide or for cross‑references from A.6.0/A.6.x/C.2.1. In all of them:

* **SlotKind** names the **place/position in the structure** (slot/field/coordinate in a tuple/record/port bundle).
* **ValueKind** is the **kind of value** admissible at that place.
* **RefKind** is the **reference/identifier type** used in episteme when that slot is filled (absent when the slot is by‑value).
* `GroundingHolon` is **not** a separate kernel type: it is simply a `U.Holon` used as the ValueKind of `GroundingHolonSlot`.

Example names like `FurnitureSafetyDescriptionKind`, `AuthPipelineSpecKind`, `ModelEvaluationResultKind`, `IncidentRunbookSpecKind`, `ServiceSLARequirementKind` are **context‑local** kinds, not new kernel tokens.

##### A.6.5:5.3.1 - Mechanics — stool on a test rig

*EpistemeKind:* `FurnitureSafetyDescriptionKind`.

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — SlotKind “what this description is about”; ValueKind `U.Entity` with EoIClass ⊑ `U.Holon` (stool as a furniture holon); RefKind `U.EntityRef` (identifier of a concrete stool `S_i`).
* `GroundingHolonSlot` — SlotKind “where the test happens”; ValueKind `U.Holon` (test rig `LabRig_j`); RefKind `U.HolonRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — SlotKind for the internal content; ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue` (graph embedded in the episteme).

*Substitutions (all under the **same** SlotKinds):*

* Episteme `E₁`: `describedEntityRef = S_1`, `groundingHolonRef = LabRig_A`.
* Episteme `E₂`: `describedEntityRef = S_2`, `groundingHolonRef = LabRig_A` — **substitute another stool in the same `DescribedEntitySlot`** (different `U.EntityRef` slot‑content).
* Episteme `E₃`: `describedEntityRef = S_1`, `groundingHolonRef = LabRig_B` — **substitute another test rig in `GroundingHolonSlot`** while keeping the same object‑of‑talk.

In all three cases the SlotKinds (and ValueKinds) are stable; only the **Refs that fill those slots** change. This matches the engineering idiom “drop another module into the same slot”.

##### A.6.5:5.3.2 - Microservices — switching the authentication provider

*EpistemeKind:* `AuthPipelineSpecKind`.

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Holon` with EoIClass = “`UserService` holon”; RefKind `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `UserService#prod`).
* `AuthProviderComponentSlot` — SlotKind “which auth provider component is used in this pipeline”; ValueKind `U.Holon` with EoIClass = “`AuthProviderSystem` holon”; RefKind `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `Auth_OIDC`, `Auth_LDAP`).
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue` (pipeline invariants and flow logic).

*Substitutions / retargetings:*

* Episteme `Spec_OIDC`: `describedEntityRef = UserService#prod`, `authProviderComponentRef = Auth_OIDC`.
* Episteme `Spec_LDAP`: same `describedEntityRef = UserService#prod`, but `authProviderComponentRef = Auth_LDAP`.

Here SlotKind is identical (`AuthProviderComponentSlot`); ValueKind is “any auth‑provider holon”; the episteme change is purely a **retargeting** of the `U.HolonRef` slot‑content.

##### A.6.5:5.3.3 - Data/ML — swapping dataset or target characteristic

*EpistemeKind:* `ModelEvaluationResultKind`.

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Method`; RefKind `U.MethodRef` (e.g. `Model_v3`).
* `DatasetSlot` — ValueKind `U.Entity` with EoIClass = “dataset”; RefKind `U.EntityRef` (`Dataset_A`, `Dataset_B`, …).
* `TargetCharacteristicSlot` — ValueKind `U.Characteristic`; RefKind `U.CharacteristicRef`.
* `GroundingHolonSlot` — ValueKind `U.Holon`; RefKind `U.HolonRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue`.

*Substitutions / retargetings:*

* `Eval_1`: `describedEntityRef = Model_v3`, `datasetRef = Dataset_A`, `targetCharacteristicRef = Accuracy`, `groundingHolonRef = EvalCluster#1`.
* `Eval_2`: same model / characteristic / cluster, but `datasetRef = Dataset_B` — **substitute another dataset in `DatasetSlot`** (retarget the dataset ref).
* `Eval_3`: same model and dataset, but `targetCharacteristicRef = F1` — **substitute another characteristic in `TargetCharacteristicSlot`**.

##### A.6.5:5.3.4 - Operational practice — the same runbook in different operating centres

*EpistemeKind:* `IncidentRunbookSpecKind`.

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Method`; RefKind `U.MethodRef`.
* `GroundingHolonSlot` — ValueKind `U.Holon`; RefKind `U.HolonRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue`.

*Substitutions / retargetings:*

* `Runbook_DC1`: `describedEntityRef = MajorIncidentRunbook`, `groundingHolonRef = DC1_NOC`.
* `Runbook_DC2`: same `describedEntityRef`, but `groundingHolonRef = DC2_NOC`.

This is “one and the same method is specified and validated in two different operational environments”: SlotKind and ValueKind are stable; only the `U.HolonRef` slot‑content differs.

##### A.6.5:5.3.5 - SLO/SLA requirements — changing the target characteristic vs changing the threshold

*EpistemeKind:* `ServiceSLARequirementKind`.

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Holon`; RefKind `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `CheckoutService#prod`).
* `TargetCharacteristicSlot` — ValueKind `U.Characteristic`; RefKind `U.CharacteristicRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue`. Numeric thresholds live **inside the ClaimGraph as literals**, not as RefKinds.

*Moves:*

* `SLA_latency_200`: `describedEntityRef = CheckoutService#prod`, `targetCharacteristicRef = P95Latency`; ClaimGraph contains `P95Latency ≤ 200 ms`.
* `SLA_latency_150`: same refs, but ClaimGraph threshold is `P95Latency ≤ 150 ms`. This is a **by‑value edit** of `ClaimGraphSlot`.
* `SLA_availability_99_9`: same `describedEntityRef`, but `targetCharacteristicRef = Availability`; ClaimGraph states `Availability ≥ 99.9%`. This is a **retargeting** of `TargetCharacteristicSlot`.

### A.6.5:6 - Bias‑Annotation

**Lenses tested and scope.** This pattern was read through all five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`) and is intended as a **universal** discipline for n‑ary relation and morphism signatures across Parts A/B/C/E. It leans toward the `Arch` and `Onto/Epist` lenses (typed signatures, explicit kinds), but mitigates this by (a) keeping the discipline notation‑agnostic, (b) aligning with existing tooling rather than prescribing any, and (c) grounding the rules in System/Episteme examples with clear didactic intent. No domain‑specific scope limitation is claimed.

* **Typed‑language bias.**

  * The pattern leans on intuitions from typed programming languages (parameter types, records, references). This is intentional: it aligns FPF signatures with mainstream tooling and with post‑2015 typed effect/row systems. The pattern remains **notation‑agnostic** and does not commit to any specific PL or logic.

* **Slot‑first bias.**

  * We treat *slot* as the primary abstraction and discourage role‑style or object‑style naming for argument positions. This favours structural clarity over conversational metaphors (“subject/object/role”) and keeps `U.Role` free for RoleEnactment rather than param‑slots.

* **By‑value/by‑ref honesty.**
  We explicitly separate ValueKind and RefKind instead of hiding “by‑reference” behind the type system. This increases verbosity but makes reasoning about edition pinning, caching, and re‑targeting more robust, and keeps I/D/S distinctions visible inside signatures.

* **Lexicon bias (precision over metaphor).**
  We standardise the slot‑operation lexicon (bind/fill/initialize/assign/retarget/resolve/mutate) and discourage metaphors that smuggle role semantics back into SlotKinds. This increases didactic load, but directly reduces cross‑pattern ambiguity, especially in “binding time” discussions.

* **Episteme‑first describedEntity.**
  The examples and cross‑references prioritise episteme use‑cases (C.2.1, A.6.2–A.6.4) where describedEntity and retargeting are subtle. System‑only usages (e.g. method signatures) are absolutely allowed but not the driving case; they inherit the same discipline without additional obligations.

### A.6.5:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A.6.5‑1 - SlotSpec for every parameter.**
Every `U.Signature` that declares an n‑ary relation or morphism **SHALL** assign to each parameter position a SlotSpec triple: `⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩`.

**CC‑A.6.5‑2 - `*Slot` discipline.**
Any Tech name ending with `…Slot` **MUST** denote a SlotKind; SlotKinds **MUST NOT** be used as ValueKinds or RefKinds.

**CC‑A.6.5‑3 - `*Ref` discipline.**
Any Tech name ending with `…Ref` **MUST** denote either a RefKind or a field whose type is a RefKind. ValueKinds and SlotKinds **MUST NOT** end in `…Ref`.

**CC‑A.6.5‑4 - ValueKind purity.**
ValueKinds **MUST** be declared without `*Slot`/`*Ref` suffixes and **MUST** be FPF types (often `U.Kind` or kernel‑level types). Any existing type whose name violates this rule must be either:

* reclassified as a RefKind, or
* renamed to drop the suffix.

**CC‑A.6.5‑5 - Episteme core SlotKinds.**
For episteme kinds (`U.EpistemeKind`), the following SlotKinds **SHALL** be used (or their documented refinements) in C.2.1 / C.2.x:

* `DescribedEntitySlot` with ValueKind `U.Entity` **or a declared subkind** (e.g. `U.Method`, `U.Holon`) via Kind‑CAL (EoIClass ⊑ `U.Entity` at species level);
* `GroundingHolonSlot` with ValueKind `U.Holon`;
* `ClaimGraphSlot` with ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph` and `ByValue` mode in the minimal core;
* `ViewpointSlot` with ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`;
* `ViewSlot` with ValueKind `U.View` (`U.EpistemeView`);
* `ReferenceSchemeSlot` with ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme` and `ByValue` mode in the minimal core.

**CC‑A.6.5‑6 - No “Role” as SlotKind head.**
SlotKinds **MUST NOT** use “Role” as their head noun; use “Slot” with a neutral qualifier instead (e.g., `EnactorHolonSlot`). `U.Role` remains reserved for RoleEnactment patterns.

**CC‑A.6.5‑7 - Substitution checks.**
Any pattern that describes substitution or replacement of arguments **MUST** phrase its rules in terms of SlotKinds and ValueKinds (and, where relevant, RefKinds), not in terms of unstructured parameter indices or ad‑hoc labels.

**CC‑A.6.5‑8 - Cross‑pattern consistency.**
When the same conceptual position is used across patterns (e.g. “describedEntity target”, “grounding holon”, “caller system”), the **same SlotKind name** and ValueKind **SHALL** be reused, unless a documented Bridge declares a different discipline or the pattern explicitly scopes itself to a distinct calculus.

**CC‑A.6.5‑9 - Migration of legacy `…Ref`/`…Slot` usage.**
Contexts adopting this pattern **MUST** maintain a migration table for legacy types/fields whose names contain `Ref` or `Slot` but do not comply with the new discipline. Each entry shall state:

* old name and role,
* new SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind,
* whether the old name becomes an alias (deprecated) or is removed.

**CC‑A.6.5‑10 - Pattern integration.**
New or revised patterns in Part A/B/C/E that introduce n‑ary relations, morphisms, or signatures **SHALL** reference A.6.5 in their Relations section and attest that they follow SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline.

**CC‑A.6.5‑11 - Slot‑content terminology.**
Normative text that refers to “what is in a slot” **SHALL** use **slot‑content** (or **slot filler**) and **SHALL NOT** rely on role/person metaphors (e.g. “occupant”) unless explicitly defined as a strict synonym for slot‑content with no added semantics.

**CC‑A.6.5‑12 - Slot‑operation verb discipline.**
Any normative description of a change “to a slot” **MUST** specify which operation class it is (initialize vs assign/set vs retarget vs by‑value edit vs resolve vs mutate/revise), using the canonical verbs in A.6.5:4.5.2 or explicitly mapping local terms to them.

**CC‑A.6.5‑13 - Binding‑time clarity.**
Any use of “early binding / late binding” (or equivalent) **MUST** specify whether it refers to:

* Identifier binding (name‑binding),
* Slot filling (early/late‑filled),
* Reference resolution / dispatch (eager/lazy‑resolved).

### A.6.5:8 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Uniform language for arguments and for operations.**
  Any n‑ary relation (episteme, role, method, service, guard) can be described with the same SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind triple **and** with a stable operation lexicon (fill/initialize/assign/retarget/resolve).

* **Safer substitutions.**
  Substitution, retargeting, and viewing laws (A.6.2–A.6.4) can be stated in terms of *which SlotKinds* they read/write and *which ValueKinds* they preserve or retarget, without accidentally collapsing into “just replace the thing”.

* **Cleaner naming and migration.**
  Misuses of `*Ref`, `*Slot`, “Role”, “Subject”, “Object” in signatures become guard‑detectable; migration strategies can be described as re‑factoring SlotKinds and ValueKinds rather than ad‑hoc renames.

* **Tool alignment.**
  Implementation languages with **row‑typed records, dependent types, and algebraic effects** map naturally to the SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind layers, easing code generation and static analysis. ([13])

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Extra metadata in signatures.**
  Every parameter now has three pieces of information instead of one. Mitigation: template support in authoring tools; pattern‑guided macros for common shapes (episteme, role, method, service).

* **Stricter lexical rules.**
  Some legacy names will need migration (`EpistemicObject`, ad‑hoc `…Ref` types). Mitigation: migration notes in F.18 and dedicated anti‑pattern sections; transitional aliases allowed but marked deprecated.

* **Learning curve.**
  Authors must learn to think “SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind” *and* distinguish “retarget vs edit vs resolve” before writing `id` or `subject`. Mitigation: Tell‑Show‑Show examples and a didactic micro‑guide on slot operations referenced from A.6.0/C.2.1/E.17.0.

### A.6.5:9 - Rationale

**Why a SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind triple at all.**
In FPF this pattern makes `U.Signature` behave like a lightweight dependently‑typed record discipline: SlotKind plays the role of an index or label, ValueKind is the family of admissible fillers at that position, and RefKind captures the representation choice (by‑value or via a handle). This mirrors the way post‑2015 work on row‑polymorphic data and effect rows treats labels and field kinds as first‑class, while keeping the Core notation‑neutral.

**Why separate ValueKind from RefKind.**
In practice, “Ref” types tend to be quietly used as if they were values, eroding the I/D/S split and making edition discipline invisible. By insisting that ValueKind is always the conceptual kind (“what sort of thing is this about?”) and RefKind is always the reference/identifier kind (“how do we point at it in Episteme?”), the pattern aligns with E.10.D2’s intension/description/specification discipline and with modern resource‑aware logics that keep values and resources distinct.

**Why add a slot‑operation lexicon.**
The triple only buys safety if authors and tools can see it at a glance **and** can narrate changes without collapsing layers. A.6.5:4.5 makes the common “put something in a slot” moves explicit: initialization vs assignment vs retargeting vs by‑value editing vs resolution. This directly reduces ambiguity in episteme morphism descriptions (A.6.2–A.6.4) and prevents accidental imports from a specific PL’s terminology.

**Why standardise episteme SlotKinds.**
describedEntity and grounding recur across epistemes; standard SlotKinds (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, etc.) let A.6.2–A.6.4 and C.2.1 talk about substitutions and retargetings once, instead of re‑defining “what this is about” in every pattern.

**Why lexical rules (`*Slot`, `*Ref`, operation verbs, no “Role” heads).**
The discipline must be cheap to apply. Reserving `*Slot` for SlotKinds and `*Ref` for RefKinds/fields gives a syntax‑level guard against conflating places, kinds, and handles. Standardising operation verbs (initialize/retarget/resolve) prevents prose from re‑introducing the same conflation by different words.

### A.6.5:10 - SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

**Purpose.** To situate SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline with respect to contemporary typed and relational approaches, without importing any external calculus into the Core. All items are used as conceptual comparators; concrete reuse in a `U.BoundedContext` would happen only via explicit Bridges (F.9) with declared CL penalties.

1. **Row‑typed, extensible data / effect rows (adopt/adapt).**
   Post‑2015 work on row polymorphism and extensible data/effect rows treats records and variants as labelled collections of fields whose presence and type can evolve independently.
   **Adopted:** the idea that **positions** (labels) are first‑class and carry their own typing discipline.
   **Adapted:** instead of row kinds, FPF uses SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind triples for n‑ary relations and epistemic slots; the pattern is notation‑agnostic and applies equally to episteme structures, role relations, and service signatures. ([13])

2. **Dependent type systems engineered via macros (adopt/adapt).**
   Macro‑based dependent type systems such as Turnstile+ separate structural indices, value‑level types, and evidence, while allowing them to be related by construction.
   **Adopted:** the separation between **indices/labels** and **values**, and the intuition that signatures should expose both explicitly.
   **Adapted:** SlotKind corresponds to a structural index, ValueKind to the ordinary type of fillers, and RefKind to runtime‑level identifiers; the discipline is phrased at the FPF specification and kept independent of any particular PL.

3. **Relational models of types‑and‑effects (adapt).**
   Relational models for types‑and‑effects distinguish value positions from effect/resource annotations and track substitution separately across these layers.
   **Adopted:** the insistence that reasoning about **substitution and equality** must be stratified (values vs additional structure).
   **Adapted:** A.6.5 stratifies *slot / value / reference* instead of *value / effect*, and applies the discipline not only to programs but also to epistemes, roles, methods, and services. ([15])

4. **Optics / lenses as disciplined projections (echo).**
   Profunctor optics formalise get/put pairs where a fixed “focus” position within a larger structure is manipulated under composition laws.
   **Echoed:** SlotKind plays the role of the focus coordinate; ValueKind is the focus type; RefKind determines whether the focus is stored by value or via a handle. This perspective informs later use of SlotKind discipline in EpistemicViewing (A.6.3) and multi‑view publication (E.17). ([16])

**Cross‑Context reuse and Bridges.** When a `U.BoundedContext` chooses to adopt a concrete row‑typing discipline, relational logic, or optics library, it **SHALL** do so via explicit Bridges (F.9) with CL and (for plane crossings) `Φ(CL)`/`Φ_plane` policy‑ids, keeping numerical policies and notations Context‑local. A.6.5 only constrains the **slot discipline** that such Bridges must respect.

### A.6.5:11 - Relations (with other patterns)

**Specialises A.6.P `U.RelationalPrecisionRestorationSuite`.**
A.6.5 is the RPR specialisation for “n‑ary relation as slots”: it restores hidden arity by making participant positions explicit as SlotKinds, and stabilises change semantics via the slot‑operation lexicon + lexical guards.


**Builds on A.6.0 `U.Signature`.**
Refines parameter declarations with SlotSpec triples `⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` while leaving the rest of the signature structure (SubjectKind, BaseType, Quantification, ResultKind, Laws) unchanged. SlotKinds become the canonical labels for argument positions.

**Constrains C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.**
Fixes core episteme SlotKinds (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and their ValueKinds/`ByValue` vs Ref discipline. C.2.1 and its extensions SHALL use these SlotKinds (or documented refinements) so that episteme morphisms can be expressed uniformly over slots.

**Supports A.6.2–A.6.4 (episteme morphisms and viewing).**
DescribedEntity‑preserving vs describedEntity‑retargeting morphisms can now be stated as constraints on which SlotKinds’ ValueKinds/RefKinds they may change. Retargeting becomes “retargeting at `DescribedEntitySlot` under a Kind‑Bridge” rather than an ad‑hoc parameter tweak. The operation lexicon in A.6.5:4.5 makes “retarget vs edit vs resolve” explicit in these morphism descriptions.

**Coordinates with B.5.* (RoleEnactment).**
Role/assignment relations may declare SlotKinds such as `HolderHolonSlot`, `RoleSlot`, `ContextSlot`, `WindowSlot` with clear ValueKinds/RefKinds, instead of overloading “role” for both holonic roles and relation positions. This keeps `U.Role` semantics (A.2, F.6) separate from slot discipline.

**Coordinates with E.17 `U.MultiViewDescribing`.**
`Viewpoint` and `View` positions are governed by SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind; view‑changing operations can be described as substitutions at specific SlotKinds that preserve ClaimGraph content while re‑indexing viewpoints and views.

**Feeds F.18 (LEX‑BUNDLE) and E.10 (LEX).**
Provides lexical guards for `*Slot` and `*Ref`, and (via A.6.5:4.5) for operation verbs:

* `*Slot` reserved for SlotKinds only;
* `*Ref` reserved for RefKinds and reference fields;
* ValueKinds and Kind names MUST NOT carry either suffix;
* slot‑operation verbs must not collapse retargeting into “editing”.

**Used by A.19 `CharacteristicSpace` and measurement patterns.**
Characteristic‑space slots already behave as positions with attached kinds; slot discipline in A.6.5 gives a uniform story for how such slots appear inside relation signatures, episteme cards, and service definitions, and how substitution over those slots is checked.
