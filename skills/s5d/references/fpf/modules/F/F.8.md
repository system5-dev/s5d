## F.8 - Mint or Reuse? (U.Type vs Concept-Set vs Role Description vs Alias)

**“Name only what thinking **requires**, and reuse everything else.”**

**Status.** Architectural pattern.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; A.7 **Strict Distinction**; A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**; A.8 **Universal Core**.
**Coordinates with.** F.1 **Contexts (Contexts)**; F.2 **Harvest**; F.3 **SenseCells**; F.4 **Role Description**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge**.
**Aliases (informative).** *Mint‑vs‑Reuse gate*; *Naming governor*.


### F.8:1 - Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **minimal, conceptual decision lattice** that answers, for any modelling need:

> “Do I **reuse** an existing label, add an **alias**, reference a **Concept‑Set row**, define a **Role Description**, or mint a **new U.Type**?”

The lattice enforces **locality of meaning** (Contexts), **senseFamily separation** (A.7), and **parsimony** (A.11) while remaining didactically simple.

**Applicability.** Use whenever a new name seems “needed” in any FPF pattern thread (**Role Assignment & Enactment**, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, Method-CAL, LCA-CAL…).

**Non‑goals.** No workflows, no roles, no storage. This is **thinking discipline**, not process guidance.


### F.8:2 - Problem frame

Modellers tend to **mint names** when they actually need **reuse**, **aliasing**, or **explicit Cross‑context reading**. Consequences:

1. **Name inflation.** Parallel labels for the same idea across Contexts.
2. **senseFamily mixing.** Behavioural **Role** names that smuggle in deontic **Status** or measurement talk.
3. **Hidden bridges.** Cross‑context sameness is implied by look‑alike words rather than declared (F.9).
4. **Kernel sprawl.** New **U.Types** appear to plaster over local vocabulary gaps.


### F.8:3 - Forces

| Force                       | Tension to resolve                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs coverage**   | Avoid new names unless necessary, yet cover recurring Cross‑context readings.                    |
| **Locality vs unification** | Keep senses **in‑Context**; when reading across, do it **explicitly** and only as far as needed. |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**   | Give readers one label to hold, but never over‑state sameness (respect CL and scope).         |


### F.8:4 - Minimal vocabulary (used in this pattern only)

* **Context** — `U.BoundedContext` (per D.CTX).
* **SenseCell** — address of a **local sense** produced by F.3 (one context × one clustered sense).
* **Concept‑Set row** — a **licensed Cross‑context reading** (F.7) of cells in one senseFamily with a declared **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.
* **senseFamily** — as defined in **F.0.1**; here used as the **typed discriminator for rows** restricted to {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. 
* **Role Description** — a **Role/Status** template anchored to a **single SenseCell** (F.4).
* **Alias** — an **additional label** for an existing FPF label (within F.5), no new semantics.
* **CL threshold τ(scope)** — the **minimum congruence level** needed for a row’s scope (e.g., τ(Naming-only) < τ(Assignment-eligibility) < τ(Type-structure)).


### F.8:5 - The decision lattice (conceptual, notation‑free)

> Read top‑to‑bottom; the **first satisfied** branch decides. At every step, **state the senseFamily** (Role / Status / Measurement / Type‑structure / Method / Execution) before you proceed.

#### F.8:5.1 - Q0 — What is the **senseFamily** of your need?

* If **uncertain**, return to F.1/F.3: stabilise the Context(s) and the local sense.
* If **mixed**, split the need: one decision **per senseFamily** (A.7).

#### F.8:5.2 - Q1 — Is there a **single Context** whose SenseCell already expresses it?

* **Yes →** **Reuse** the **SenseCell**’s label **inside that Context**.

  * If you need assignable behaviour or deontics on that sense: **define a Role Description** **anchored to that SenseCell** (F.4).
* **No →** go to Q2.

> *Example (engineer).* You want “**task execution**” in control software. In `IEC 61131‑3` there is a clear SenseCell for **task execution**. **Reuse** that label; if you need responsibilities (“who monitors runs”), define a **Role Description** anchored to this SenseCell.

#### F.8:5.3 - Q2 — Do you need to **read across Contexts** (same senseFamily)?

* **No →** stay within one context; if your desire is merely a nicer label, consider an **Alias** (Q3).
* **Yes →** check F.7 for a **Concept‑Set row** covering your cells **in this senseFamily** with adequate **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.

  * **Found & sufficient →** **Reuse the row’s FPF label** at that scope.
  * **Not found or insufficient →** either (a) **publish a contrast** (teach difference), or (b) propose a **new row** but only after F.9 Bridges exist at **τ(scope)**.

> *Example (manager).* You want one label for the **actor** in workflow and provenance prose. F.7 has a **Naming‑only** row mapping *BPMN Participant* ↔ *PROV Agent* at CL = 2. **Reuse** “actor” **at Naming‑only** scope; do **not** infer identity in models.

#### F.8:5.4 - Q3 — Is this **only a wording preference** for an existing FPF label?

* **Yes →** add an **Alias** in F.5 (Tech register and/or Plain register), no semantics changed.
* **No →** go to Q4.

> *Example (researcher).* You prefer “**is‑a**” to “**subclass‑of**” in Type pages. That is an **Alias** for the same concept; no new row, no new U.Type.

#### F.8:5.5 - Q4 — Does your need recur across Contexts in a way **not captured** by current rows, **with Bridges** already available at the required CL?

* **Yes →** propose a **new Concept‑Set row** (F.7): small (2–4 Contexts), **one senseFamily**, declare **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**, include a **counter‑example** if any Bridge has loss notes.
* **No →** go to Q5.

> *Example (engineer).* You repeatedly compare **runtime occurrence** in PROV with **PLC task runs**. F.9 Bridges exist at CL = 2. Propose **row “execution-occurrence”** at **assignment/enactment-eligibility** scope (not Type-structure).

#### F.8:5.6 - Q5 — Are you describing a **kernel‑level notion** missing from the catalogue, **not** reducible to existing rows or Role Descriptions, and **present across ≥ 3 domain families** (A.8)?

* **Yes →** propose a **new U.Type** (rare). Supply:
  (i) the minimal **intensional definition**; (ii) cross‑family evidence (≥ 3 Contexts, **distinct families**); (iii) how it **doesn’t** duplicate an existing U.Type.
* **No →** you **do not mint** a new type. Re‑express the need in terms of **Context reuse**, **row reuse**, **Alias**, or a **Role Description**.

> *Example (researcher).* You think we need **U.InfluenceEdge** (causal tendency). If it appears as a stable, **senseFamily‑specific** notion across **control**, **epistemic inference**, and **methods** (≥ 3 families), and cannot be formed from existing `U.Relation` subtypes, it **may** qualify. Otherwise, treat it as a **pattern** or a **row**.


### F.8:6 - Scope thresholds (default τ) — **how much sameness** you’re allowed to claim

| Row / Use Scope     | What it licenses                                                                              | Default τ (minimum CL) | Typical consumers                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------: | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Naming‑only**     | Shared label in prose, diagrams, and primers; **no inference**.                               |                  **1** | Pedagogy, glossary, didactic figures.     |
| **Assignment-eligibility** | Safe to reference the row’s target as the **thing a `U.RoleAssignment` may point to** (e.g., a run, a value). | **2** | F.4 Role Description, acceptance narratives. |
| **KD‑metric**       | Treat cells as the **same measured outcome** (unit‑compatible, procedure‑compatible).         |                  **2** | Measurement summaries, SLO tables.        |
| **Type‑structure**  | Treat cells as the **same structural relation** (e.g., subtyping) with inheritance semantics. |                  **3** | Kind-CAL pages, structural proofs.        |

> **Guard.** You may **tighten** scope (e.g., from Naming-only → Assignment-eligibility) **only** if the **Row CL(min)** meets the **higher τ**.


### F.8:7 - Micro‑examples (didactic triad)

#### F.8:7.1 - For engineers — “Do we need a new **Execution** label?”

* **Need.** “We want to refer to **what actually happened** in both provenance logs and PLC runtime.”
* **senseFamily.** Execution - **stance.** run.
* **Contexts.** `PROV‑O` (Activity), `IEC 61131‑3` (task run).
* **Row?** F.7 has **execution-occurrence** at **assignment/enactment-eligibility**, CL = 2.
* **Decision.** **Reuse** that row’s label at **Assignment-eligibility**; **no** new U.Type; define Role Descriptions **anchored to each Context** as needed.

#### F.8:7.2 - For managers — “Can we call them all **actors**?”

* **Need.** A single everyday word in the spec to denote “the responsible party”.
* **senseFamily.** Role (behavioural mask in prose).
* **Contexts.** `BPMN 2.0` (Participant), `PROV‑O` (Agent).
* **Row?** **Naming‑only** row “actor”, CL = 2.
* **Decision.** **Reuse** “actor” **in prose only**; keep Context‑loyal labels in formal sections. No Role Description minted unless tied to one context.

#### F.8:7.3 - For researchers — “New **U.Type** for ‘Work Scope’?”

* **Need.** Kernel notion capturing **feasible performance region** across systems.
* **Test A.8.** Appears in **control** (reachable sets), **services** (operating envelope), **measurement** (confidence bands): **≥ 3 families?**
* **Reduction test.** Can it be expressed as a **row** + existing `U.Relation` + KD‑CAL constructs?
* **Decision.** If **not reducible** and **cross‑family stable**, propose **new U.Type** with minimal definition; otherwise, prefer a **row** or a **pattern**.


### F.8:8 - Invariants (normative, lightweight)

1. **Context‑first.** Every decision cites at least one **Context**; no global senses.
2. **senseFamily purity.** A single decision covers **one senseFamily**. Mixed needs are split.
3. **Row honesty.** Any Cross‑context reuse occurs **via a Concept‑Set row** at or above **τ(scope)**; no stealth equivalence.
4. **Role Description anchoring.** Role Descriptions are **single-Context**, **single-cell** anchors (F.4).
5. **Alias modesty.** Aliases **never** change semantics and live under F.5.
6. **Kernel restraint.** New **U.Types** are **rare**; A.8 **(≥ 3 families)** is mandatory, and duplication with existing U.Types must be ruled out.


### F.8:8.1 - Mint/Reuse discipline for **policy-ids** (normative addendum)

FPF treats **policy-ids** (e.g., `Φ(CL)`, `Φ_plane`, `Ψ(CL^k)`, `Aut-Guard`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `InsertionPolicyRef`, Acceptance clause ids) as **first-class, versioned tokens**. They are not “just strings”, and they are not governed by tier ladders or implied authority.

**PolicySpecRef.** A **resolvable reference** to the normative definition of a policy-id (“what does this policy-id mean?”). At minimum it:
* identifies the policy-id,
* pins an immutable edition (or equivalent digest), and
* can be located from the same publication bundle (MVPK / UTS / EvidenceGraph anchors).

**MintDecisionRef.** A **resolvable reference** to the decision record that introduced (minted) a policy-id into a declared namespace/registry. For **normative** policy-ids this is typically a **DRR id** (E.9) or an equivalent change decision record. For **purely local, non-exported** policy-ids it MAY be a Gate `DecisionLog` entry (A.21) if that local-only scope is explicit.

**PolicyIdRef (canonical bundle).**  
`PolicyIdRef := { policy_id, PolicySpecRef, MintDecisionRef? }`.

**Rules.**
1. **No silent policy-id minting.** If a publication introduces a *new* policy-id (not previously present in the declared namespace/registry), it **MUST** surface a `PolicyIdRef` whose:
   * `PolicySpecRef` is edition-pinned, and
   * `MintDecisionRef` is resolvable from the publication’s DRR/DecisionLog links.
2. **Reuse is reference-only.** If a publication **reuses** an existing policy-id, it **MUST** surface a `PolicySpecRef` (and **SHOULD** preserve the prior mint decision link where available). It **MUST NOT** restate policy semantics *as if* minting a new policy-id.
3. **GateCrossing checkability.** Any GateCrossing/CrossingBundle that surfaces policy-ids **MUST** include `PolicyIdRef` (or an equivalent “policy-id + resolvable refs” structure) so GateChecks can verify resolvability and pin consistency (E.18/A.21/G.6:7.5.8).
4. **Authority is policy, not tiers.** “Who may mint” vs “who may reuse” is expressed by the referenced **policy specs** and **mint decisions** (and enforced by the active GateProfile/GateChecks), not by fixed tier labels.

| You feel you need…                          | Likely action                  | Why                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| A convenient everyday word across two Contexts | **Reuse a Naming‑only row**    | Keeps prose simple without smuggling inference.  |
| An assignable mask with invariants          | **Role Description (single Context)** | Roles/Statuses attach to **local** senses.       |
| The same measured outcome across Contexts      | **Reuse a KD‑metric row**      | Units/procedures aligned at CL ≥ 2.              |
| A unifying schema relation (e.g., is‑a)     | **Reuse a Type‑structure row** | Structural inference preserved at CL ≥ 3.        |
| A nicer label for the same FPF concept      | **Alias in F.5**               | Style only; zero semantics.                      |
| A brand‑new primitive concept               | **New U.Type (rare)**          | Only if cross‑family, irreducible, kernel‑level. |

### F.8:10 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #         | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom                                                                            | Why it harms thinking                              | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AP‑1**  | **Row‑less sameness**      | Declaring “these mean the same” across Contexts without citing a **Concept‑Set row**. | Imports meaning implicitly; no CL guard.           | If Cross‑context reuse is desired, **reuse an existing row** at a declared **scope** (F.7), else **publish the contrast** and defer to F.9 Bridges. |
| **AP-2**  | **Scope creep**            | Using a **Naming-only** row to justify **Assignment-eligibility** or structural inferences. | Over-claims sameness; breaks τ(scope).             | Respect **scope thresholds** (τ). Upgrade only when **Row CL(min) ≥ τ(new scope)**; otherwise stay Naming-only.                                  |
| **AP‑3**  | **Alias with payload**     | Introducing an Alias that subtly changes intent or senseFamily.                          | Hides semantics behind wording; confuses senseFamilies.   | Aliases (F.5) are **style only**. If semantics change, choose **row reuse** or **Role Description** instead.                                         |
| **AP-4**  | **Role-Description-to-row anchoring** | Role Description points to a **row** rather than a **single SenseCell**.       | Masks locality; **assignments** become cross-context by stealth. | Role Descriptions **must anchor to one SenseCell** (F.4). Use rows only in prose or aggregated views.                                                |
| **AP‑5**  | **Kernel inflation**       | Proposing a new **U.Type** because a convenient label is missing.                  | Duplicates the kernel; violates parsimony.         | Apply A.8: require **≥ 3 domain families** and **irreducibility**; otherwise **Alias** or **row**.                                               |
| **AP‑6**  | **senseFamily mixing**           | One name that conflates Role, Status, Measurement, or Type‑structure.              | Collapses A.7 Strict Distinction.                  | **Split by senseFamily** first (Q0). Decide **per senseFamily**.                                                                                             |
| **AP‑7**  | **Bridge‑by‑string**       | Treating identical surface forms as equivalent senses across Contexts.                | Homonym trap; ignores local sense.                 | Equivalence only via **F.9 Bridge** + **row**; never by string.                                                                                  |
| **AP‑8**  | **Row without loss notes** | Publishing a row where Bridges indicate mismatches, but row text is silent.        | Readers assume full equivalence.                   | Include **counter‑example** and **loss sketch** in the row’s narrative (F.7).                                                                    |
| **AP‑9**  | **CL laundering**          | Citing a high‑scope row based on old high CL while Bridges have since weakened.    | Invalidates downstream claims.                     | When CL falls below τ(scope), **downgrade row scope** (e.g., to Naming‑only) or **split row**.                                                   |
| **AP‑10** | **Global normal form**     | Seeking one canonical wording across all Contexts **as if** meaning were global.      | Erases locality; fuels hidden merges.              | Keep normalisation **per Context** (F.2/F.3). Cross‑context sameness lives in **rows** with scope.                                                     |


### F.8:11 - Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Each item states a **mental entailment**. No storage, no roles, no workflows. Symbols: `C` = Context, `σ` = SenseCell, `R` = Concept‑Set row, `SF` = senseFamily, `τ` = scope threshold, `CL` = congruence level.

1. **senseFamily split**
   `need(n) ∧ mixedSF(n) ⊢ split(n) into {n₁…nₖ} by senseFamily`
   *You cannot decide for mixed senseFamilies; decide per senseFamily.*

2. **Cell reuse**
   `∃ C,σ : expresses(n,SF)@σ ⊢ reuseLabel(σ) in C`
   *If a single Context’s SenseCell already says it, reuse it locally.*

3. **Assignment-eligibility**
   `reuseLabel(σ) ∧ needAssignable(SF ∈ {Role,Status}) ⊢ mintRoleDescription(σ)`
   *When you need assignable behaviour/deontics for a local sense, mint a Role Description anchored to that sense.*

4. **Row reuse**
   `crossContexts(n,SF) ∧ ∃ R: covers(R,SF) ∧ CL(R) ≥ τ(scope) ⊢ reuseRow(R,scope)`
   *For Cross‑context readings, reuse a row at a scope whose τ is met.*

5. **Alias suffices**
   `sameIntent(n,label₀) ∧ stylePreference(n,label₁) ⊢ alias(label₀,label₁)`
   *If it’s only wording, add an Alias; no semantics move.*

6. **Row proposal**
   `recurrentCross(n,SF) ∧ bridgesCL(cells(n)) ≥ τ(scope) ∧ ¬∃R ⊢ proposeRow(cells,scope)`
   *If the need recurs and Bridges support the scope, propose a new row.*

7. **Kernel minting (rare)**
   `kernelCandidate(n) ∧ crossFamily≥3 ∧ irreducible(n) ⊢ proposeUType(n)`
   *Only if the notion is cross‑family and cannot be reduced to cells+rows+existing U.Types.*

8. **Scope downgrade**
   `reuseRow(R,scope) ∧ CL(R)↓ < τ(scope) ⊢ downgradeScope(R)`
   *If CL falls, lower the row’s licensed scope.*

9. **Row rejection**
   `conflictEvidence(rowCells) ∧ lossUnbounded ⊢ rejectRow`
   *If bridges show open‑ended loss, do not publish a row; teach the contrast.*


### F.8:12 - Extended worked examples

#### F.8:12.1 - **Execution, observation, and acceptance** (engineers)

**Need.** A reusable label for “what actually happened and how it was checked against the promise”.
**senseFamilies.** Execution (stance: run); Measurement (KD); Status (accept/reject).

**Contexts.**
`IEC 61131‑3` (task run), `PROV‑O` (Activity), `SOSA/SSN` (Observation), `ITIL 4` (SLO/SLA).

**Reasoning.**

* `Execution`: `IEC` SenseCell (task run) and `PROV` SenseCell (Activity). There exists a **row** *execution-occurrence* at **Assignment-eligibility** with CL = 2 → **reuse row** at **Assignment-eligible** scope; do not infer Type-structure.
* `Measurement`: `SOSA` Observation cell; no Cross‑context needed → **reuse cell**.
* `Status`: `ITIL` SLO/SLA cell; **Role Description** “SLO‑Target” anchored to ITIL cell.

**Outcome.** Prose may say: “This **execution-occurrence** (row\@assignment/enactment-eligibility) was **observed** (SOSA cell) and **evaluated against the SLO** (ITIL cell).” No new U.Type; no hidden merges.


#### F.8:12.2 - **Actor across workflow and provenance** (managers)

**Need.** A single everyday label for “the responsible party” in diagrams.
**senseFamily.** Role (behavioural mask in prose/diagrams).

**Contexts.** `BPMN 2.0` (Participant), `PROV‑O` (Agent).

**Reasoning.** A **Naming‑only** row “actor” exists, CL = 2. **Reuse the row** at Naming‑only.
If assignable behaviour is needed in a model, **mint Role Description** anchored to **BPMN Participant** (not to the row).

**Outcome.** Diagrams show “actor”; formal sections reference `Participant` or `Agent` as appropriate.


#### F.8:12.3 - **Accuracy across metrology and data quality** (researchers)

**Need.** Treat “accuracy” consistently across ISO 80000 (metrology) and ISO/IEC 25024 (data quality).
**senseFamily.** Measurement.

**Contexts.** `ISO 80000‑1` (quantity/units), `ISO/IEC 25024` (data quality).

**Reasoning.** Bridges indicate **related but not identical** definitions; procedures differ. Existing **KD‑metric** row “accuracy” has CL = 2 with **loss note**: *population vs instrument focus*. **Reuse row** at KD‑metric scope for dashboards; **do not** use the row to justify interchange of procedures.

**Outcome.** One label in reports; method sections still cite the context‑local procedure.


#### F.8:12.4 **Subtype relation across OWL and a curated taxonomy** (formalists)

**Need.** Present “is‑a” uniformly across OWL 2 classes and a domain taxonomy.
**senseFamily.** Type‑structure.

**Contexts.** `OWL 2` (SubClassOf), `Taxonomy_X` (curated “is‑a” edges).

**Reasoning.** F.7 row “subtype‑order” exists at **Type‑structure scope** with CL = 3 (only after verifying acyclicity & anti‑symmetry in `Taxonomy_X`). If the curated taxonomy contains cycles, **downgrade** to Naming‑only or reject the row.

**Outcome.** When CL≥3, you may **reuse row** for structural proofs; else teach differences.


### F.8:13 - Relations (with other patterns)

* **Builds on:** E.10.D1 (D.CTX) **Context ≡ U.BoundedContext**; F.1 Contexts; F.2 Harvest; F.3 SenseCells.
* **Constrains:**

  * **F.4 Role Description:** **one SenseCell per Role Description**; no row anchoring.
  * **F.5 Naming:** Aliases are style‑only; no semantics movement.
  * **F.7 Concept‑Set:** rows must declare **Scope** & **Row CL(min)** and carry **loss notes**.
  * **F.9 Bridges:** any row proposal presupposes Bridges at or above τ(scope).
* **Used by.** All patterns (Part C) whenever new labels are contemplated.


### F.8:14 - Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Old “anchor” language.** Replace legacy “anchor” with: **SenseCell** (local sense) + **Role Description** (assignable Standard) + (optionally) **Concept‑Set row** (Cross‑context reading).
2. **Over-strong rows.** If a row was used for **assignment/enactment-eligibility** or **Type-structure** but **CL drops**, **downgrade row scope** to **Naming-only** in prose; adjust examples.
3. **Split rows.** If one row covers cells whose Bridges diverge, **split** into two narrower rows with explicit loss notes.
4. **Alias proliferation.** Collapse redundant Aliases under a single F.5 entry; keep both registers (Tech/Plain).
5. **Proto‑types.** Suspect kernel inflation? Attempt **reduction**: SenseCell + row + existing U.Type. Only if irreducible across ≥ 3 families, reopen as a U.Type candidate.


### F.8:15 - Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

#### F.8:15.1 - Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F8‑S01 (senseFamily purity).** Every decision record names **one senseFamily**; mixed needs are split.
* **SCR‑F8‑S02 (Proper anchoring).** Every Role Description cites **one SenseCell**; **no row** is used as a assignment/enactment anchor.
* **SCR‑F8‑S03 (Row scope).** Whenever a row is reused, its **Scope** is stated and **Row CL(min) ≥ τ(scope)** holds.
* **SCR‑F8‑S04 (Alias modesty).** Aliases introduced in F.5 do **not** claim new semantics or change senseFamily.
* **SCR‑F8‑S05 (Kernel restraint).** Any new U.Type proposal includes **≥ 3 domain families** of evidence and an **irreducibility** note.

#### F.8:15.2 - Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F8‑E01 (CL drift).** If any Bridge’s CL changes, re‑evaluate dependent rows; **downgrade or split** where τ(scope) is no longer met.
* **RSCR-F8-E02 (Row overuse).** Scan examples: no case uses **Naming-only** rows to justify **Assignment-eligibility** or **Type-structure** claims.
* **RSCR‑F8‑E03 (Alias creep).** Ensure no Alias has accreted senseFamily‑specific semantics; if it has, migrate to a **row** or **Role Description**.
* **RSCR‑F8‑E04 (Kernel hygiene).** New U.Type proposals are rejected if a **SenseCell + row** construction suffices.


### F.8:16 - Didactic distillation (90‑second teaching script)

> “When you feel like coining a new name, pause. **Which senseFamily** are you in—Role, Status, Measurement, Type‑structure, Method, or Execution? If a **single Context’s SenseCell** already says it, **reuse** that label. If you need an assignable Standard, **mint a Role Description** anchored to that SenseCell. If you must read **across Contexts**, reuse a **Concept‑Set row**—but only **at a stated scope** and only if its **CL meets the threshold** (τ). If it’s just a nicer wording, add an **Alias** (style only). Only in the rare case of a cross‑family, **irreducible** notion do you **mint a new U.Type**. Never let Naming‑only rows justify  **Assignment-eligibility** or structural inference, and never let identical strings force equivalence. This is not process—it’s **discipline of thought**: reuse what exists, declare scope when you bridge, and mint new primitives only when the kernel truly needs them.”
