## F.9.1 - Bridge Stance Overlay

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**Plain-name.** Bridge-card stance overlay.
**One-line summary.** `BridgeStanceOverlay` governs one stance annotation over an existing `F.9` bridge card so authors can say how to read that bridge without changing its kind, direction, `CL`, or loss notes and without treating the overlay as bridge authority or as a cure for missing stronger-source return.
**Governed object in plain terms.** One overlay annotation attached to an existing `F.9` bridge card; not the bridge card itself, not a second bridge kind, and not the pattern that governs weakened renderings.
**Use this when.** Use this overlay when an existing bridge card already exists and the real need is one compact stance label such as `localRename`, `operationalizes`, `partialAnalogy`, `projection`, or `nonEquivalent` that helps readers interpret that bridge without widening its substitution licence.
**Start here when.** Your first honest artefact is already an `F.9` bridge card, and the practical question is how to read that bridge rather than whether a bridge exists at all.
**What goes wrong if missed.** Authors fall back to vague phrases like "roughly analogous" or "just a rename", and readers either over-read the gloss as silent bridge authority or under-read it as disposable style.
**What this buys.** One compact interpretive gloss over an existing bridge card that stays reusable, keeps the bridge taxonomy stable, and still leaves stronger-source return and bridge publication duties where they belong.
**Not this pattern when.** Not this overlay when the case is the bridge card itself under `F.9`, or when a weakened rendering still needs stronger-source return before any bridge-bearing use is lawful; use `A.6.3.CSC Controlled Semantic Coarsening` for that weaker-rendering relation.


### F.9.1:1 - Problem frame
When positions or trajectories in language-state work are compared across schools or contexts, authors often need a disciplined interpretive gloss on top of a formal bridge card. The gloss must help reading without becoming a second bridge taxonomy.

### F.9.1:2 - Problem
Authors often express stance informally ("roughly analogous", "really a projection", "just a rename"), which makes bridge interpretation unstable. A full second taxonomy would be worse: it would compete with the core bridge kinds.

### F.9.1:3 - Forces
| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Expressive stance vs bridge discipline** | Add interpretive clarity without introducing a rival bridge-kind system. |
| **Reuse vs inflation** | Make stance annotations reusable across bundles while keeping bridge cards structurally governed by `F.9`. |
| **Interpretive help vs substitution abuse** | Help readers interpret a bridge without silently licensing stronger substitution than `F.9` allows. |

### F.9.1:4 - Solution
A Bridge Stance Overlay is a local interpretive annotation attached to an existing `F.9` bridge card. It does not change the underlying bridge kind, direction, `CL`, or loss notes.

#### F.9.1:4.1 - Starter overlay vocabulary
| Stance | Intended reading | What it does **not** imply |
|---|---|---|
| `localRename` | the target term is near-renaming within the current context boundary; if a cross-context relation is live, the `F.9` bridge card must exist first | automatic cross-context identity |
| `operationalizes` | the target is a procedural or operational reading aid over the declared bridge | enactment, implementation, execution permission, gate approval, `A.15` work authority, or type-structure equivalence |
| `partialAnalogy` | some explanatory pattern is shared, but only partially | lawful substitution |
| `projection` | the target is a deliberate reduction or aspectual projection of the source bridge reading | completeness, reversibility, loss governance, recoverability governance, narrower-use permission, or source reopen |
| `nonEquivalent` | the apparent similarity is not strong enough for equivalence or silent substitution | `Disjoint`, `CL=0`, or a full incompatibility verdict unless the bridge card itself says so |

#### F.9.1:4.2 - Boundary rule
A stance annotation is interpretive help for authors and readers. It is not a second bridge ontology, not a bridge card, and not a permission or authority-bearing publication.

It is also not a coarsening branch. Labels such as `projection` or `nonEquivalent` may help a reader interpret an already-declared bridge, but they do not carry source tether, narrower-use, forbidden-use, or reopen duty for a weakened rendering. If that weaker-rendering contract becomes primary, it belongs to `A.6.3.CSC Controlled Semantic Coarsening` rather than being absorbed into stance language. If stronger-source return is still needed before any bridge reading is lawful, reopen that stronger source before adding stance.

#### F.9.1:4.3 - Relation to `CL` and loss
- `CL` still governs substitution licence.
- loss notes still govern what fails to carry.
- stance annotations merely say how the author wants the bridge to be read.

If the stance materially affects interpretation, the bridge card should publish explicit loss notes that match it.

### F.9.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding
**Tell.** A stance annotation says how to read the bridge, not what the bridge kind structurally is.

**Show (System).** An operator alarm label may `operationalizes` a broader control cue without becoming identical to it.

**Show (Episteme).** A TAE felt-sense phrase may be only a `partialAnalogy` to a later formal term.

### F.9.1:6 - Bias-Annotation
Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** for stance overlays attached to existing `F.9` Bridge Cards inside FPF.
This pattern favors disciplined cross-school comparison and bridge readability over sweeping synonym claims. The main mitigation is that every stance remains subordinate to the underlying Bridge Card, its direction, `CL`, and loss notes, with explicit reroute to `A.6.3.CSC` when the live burden is weaker-source return rather than bridge-card reading.

### F.9.1:7 - Conformance Checklist
- `CC-F.9.1-1` A stance annotation **SHALL NOT** replace the underlying `F.9` bridge kind.
- `CC-F.9.1-2` Stance annotations **SHOULD** be accompanied by explicit loss notes when they materially affect interpretation.
- `CC-F.9.1-3` `nonEquivalent` **SHALL** block silent substitution.
- `CC-F.9.1-4` A stance annotation **SHALL NOT** claim stronger sameness than the bridge card's `CL` and kind allow.
- `CC-F.9.1-5` A stance annotation **SHALL NOT** stand in for stronger-source return when a weakened rendering still needs reopen before any bridge-bearing reading is lawful; that relation belongs to `A.6.3.CSC Controlled Semantic Coarsening`.

### F.9.1:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them
- **Annotation as ontology.** Do not treat stance as the bridge kind itself.
- **Friendly-vague analogy.** If the relation is high-loss, say so explicitly.
- **Stance inflation.** Do not use the annotation to smuggle in substitution rights that `F.9` withholds.
- **Stance as weaker-rendering cure.** Do not add `projection`, `localRename`, or another overlay as if that repaired a weakened note that still needs stronger-source return before bridge reading.

### F.9.1:9 - Consequences
The benefit is reusable interpretive clarity for bridge-heavy bundles and school comparisons. The trade-off is one more declared annotation layer on bridge cards.

### F.9.1:10 - Rationale
`U.LanguageStateSpace` and `U.LanguageStateTransductionTrajectory` create many legitimate cross-school comparisons. `F.9.1` gives those comparisons a reusable stance vocabulary without fragmenting the underlying `F.9` bridge discipline.

The practical gain is narrow but real: teams already use short stance glosses in review work, and without a governed overlay those glosses either smuggle bridge strength through casual wording or sprawl into a second bridge taxonomy. Keeping the overlay subordinate to the bridge card lets bundles reuse interpretive cues while the boundary rule and the worked `projection` anti-case keep stronger-source return and bridge publication duty where they belong.

### F.9.1:11 - SoTA-Echoing
**SoTA note.** This section does not mint an independent second bridge rule track. It stays truthful only when the boundary rule, conformance checklist, worked bridge-card examples, and legacy-note repair below still tell the same story about the stance staying subordinate to the bridge card.

**Traditions covered.** This overlay binds itself to comparative-theory glossing, design-translation annotation, operator documentation, and other practices that add short interpretive stance labels on top of already governed relation cards.

| Claim need | SoTA practice (post-2015) | Primary source (post-2015) | Alignment with `F.9.1` | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A short stance label can help reading only if the underlying concept/relation remains explicit. | Terminology practice distinguishes concepts, designations, definitions, and relations, and treats a designation as a representation of a concept rather than the concept itself. | ISO 704:2022; ISO 1087:2019. | `F.9.1` lets a stance word such as `localRename` or `projection` guide reading only after the underlying `F.9` bridge card remains primary. | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt designation/concept separation; adapt it into local stance overlays; reject treating the stance word as a bridge kind. |
| Viewpoint notes and model annotations help users only when they remain subordinate to the described relation. | Architecture-description and model-based engineering practice use viewpoints, views, model elements, and traceable semantics to keep explanatory surfaces tied to explicit underlying descriptions. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022; OMG SysML v2.0 Language Specification (2025). | `F.9.1` keeps stance overlays subordinate to bridge kind, direction, `CL`, and loss notes, with worked examples showing where the overlay helps and where it must wait. | **Adapt.** Adapt viewpoint/traceability discipline to bridge-card reading; reject a second bridge taxonomy. |
| Shared operational names and semantic attributes aid observability and documentation, but common naming does not by itself license substitution. | Contemporary observability practice standardizes common operation and data names while keeping those conventions tied to explicit resources, spans, metrics, logs, and profiles. | OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions (2025). | `F.9.1` adopts the value of short reusable glosses, but keeps them local to the bridge card and loss notes. | **Adapt/Reject.** Adapt common-name discipline as a readability aid; reject common naming as proof of equivalence or completeness. |
| Validation and metadata practice keeps annotations inspectable instead of letting them replace the object they annotate. | Semantic-web validation and catalog practice separates shapes/metadata from the data graph or dataset being described. | W3C SHACL (2017); W3C DCAT v3 (2024). | `F.9.1` treats a stance overlay as inspectable annotation over a bridge card, not as a substitute bridge or source-return cure. | **Adapt.** Use annotation discipline to keep stance local and reviewable. |

**Worked-slice docking.** The nearest practical recovery anchors here are the `localRename`, `operationalizes`, `projection`, and `partialAnalogy` examples in `F.9.1:13.1` through `F.9.1:13.4`, plus the anti-case `F.9.1:13.5`. If the SoTA claim cannot be recovered through those worked slices and the early boundary rule, do not let the citation stand in for the live pattern law.

**Local stance.** Best-known current practice supports a narrow rule: stance labels are useful only when they stay visibly subordinate to a published bridge card, its direction, `CL`, loss notes, and reviewable source-target structure.

### F.9.1:12 - Relations
- Builds on: `F.9`, `C.2.2a`.
- Primary boundary: `F.9` owns Bridge Card discipline; `F.9.1` owns only stance overlays attached to existing Bridge Cards.
- Coordinates with: `A.16.0`, `E.17.1`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.A`, `A.6.Q`, `C.25`, and `B.4.1`.
- Constrains: local stance annotations on bridge cards used in comparative and tradition bundles.
### F.9.1:13 - Worked Bridge-Card Examples

#### F.9.1:13.1 - `localRename`
A bridge card may relate two near-coextensive operational labels inside one declared context fragment and mark the stance as `localRename`. The bridge card still publishes its own direction, kind, `CL`, and loss notes. The stance only warns the reader that the author's intended reading is close renaming **within that boundary**; it does not license export of the rename beyond the stated fragment.

#### F.9.1:13.2 - `operationalizes`
A high-level capability cue may be bridged to a more procedural checklist or control ritual. The bridge card may carry the stance `operationalizes` to show that the target is being read as a procedural or operational gloss over the source. The relation can still be high-loss: the procedural target need not preserve the source's broader theoretical framing, and the stance does not claim type-structure sameness, implementation authority, execution permission, gate approval, or `A.15` work authority.

#### F.9.1:13.3 - `projection`
A rich construct may be mapped into a narrower reporting or measurement rendering. The bridge card may declare the stance `projection` when the target intentionally keeps only one aspect. The required loss notes should name the dropped dimensions, because the stance is informative only when the omitted structure is made explicit.

Table-level note: `projection` is only a stance over a declared bridge. It does not govern loss, recoverability, narrower allowed use, forbidden heavier use, or source reopen for a weakened rendering; that relation belongs to `A.6.3.CSC Controlled Semantic Coarsening`.

#### F.9.1:13.4 - `partialAnalogy` and `nonEquivalent`
A comparative bundle may need to mention an explanatory resemblance across traditions without claiming substitution. In such cases `partialAnalogy` may guide reading when the shared pattern is local and declared. If review concludes that even this local resemblance is too weak for safe reuse, `nonEquivalent` should be preferred so that apparent similarity does not drift into silent replacement. The label blocks equivalence and silent substitution; it does not by itself assert `Disjoint` or `CL=0` unless the underlying `F.9` bridge card says so.

#### F.9.1:13.5 - `projection` is not a weaker-note cure
A team may write a short comparison note saying that one report-only metric is `basically a projection` of a richer operations concept. That sentence does not by itself justify a `projection` overlay. First recover the underlying `F.9` bridge card, its direction, `CL`, and Loss Notes from the stronger source-bearing material. Only then may the overlay say how to read that bridge. If readers still need stronger-source return before any bridge-bearing use is lawful, the overlay must wait; it cannot repair the missing bridge card.

### F.9.1:14 - Practical use guidance

- Publish a stance overlay only on top of a complete bridge card that already declares bridge kind, direction, `CL`, and explicit loss notes where needed.
- Choose the weakest stance that truthfully describes the intended reading; do not strengthen the overlay merely because it sounds more helpful.
- If multiple interpretive notes are needed, prefer one primary stance plus explicit loss notes rather than several competing overlays.
- Use `nonEquivalent` when the main value of the annotation is to warn the reader away from substitution.
- In comparative sets or tradition-focused bundles, place the overlay near the bridge card it qualifies so readers can inspect structural bridge data before reading the interpretive gloss.

A practical check is simple: ask whether the overlay merely helps reading or is covertly claiming extra sameness, transport, or substitution rights. If it does the latter, revise the bridge card itself rather than decorating it.

### F.9.1:15 - Legacy-note repair and boundary
Legacy comparative notes often contain undeclared stance language such as "roughly the same", "really a projection", or "just an operational version". When such material is normalized, the first repair step is to recover the underlying bridge card in `F.9`; only then may a Bridge Stance Overlay be added as an explicit local stance annotation.

The pattern intentionally does not define a second bridge taxonomy, a new substitution calculus, or a score for bridge quality. Those responsibilities remain with the bridge card, `CL`, and declared loss discipline. Tradition bundles may carry many bridge cards with stance overlays, but the overlays remain local annotations attached to those cards, not free-standing comparative objects.
### F.9.1:16 - Overlay Declaration Discipline

A stance overlay is useful only when it stays visibly subordinate to the bridge card it qualifies.

#### F.9.1:16.1 - Minimal overlay declaration
A usable stance overlay should normally publish:

- the qualified `F.9` bridge card,
- the chosen stance term,
- the local reason the stance is helpful,
- and any loss emphasis that becomes especially important under that stance.

Without this declaration set, a stance word becomes a decorative gloss detached from the bridge it is supposed to interpret.

#### F.9.1:16.2 - One primary stance per bridge card
A bridge card should normally carry one primary stance overlay. If several interpretive notes are needed, the extras should usually live in explicit loss notes or surrounding commentary rather than in several competing stance tags.

#### F.9.1:16.3 - Overlay locality
A stance overlay is local to the bridge card and context fragment that publish it. Reusing the same stance label elsewhere is lawful only when the new bridge card independently supports that reading.

### F.9.1:17 - Interaction with `CL`, Direction, and Loss

#### F.9.1:17.1 - `CL` remains prior
If the stance sounds friendlier than the declared `CL`, `CL` wins. An `operationalizes` or `localRename` overlay cannot overrule a high-loss bridge or a low-substitution `CL` declaration.

#### F.9.1:17.2 - Direction-sensitive reading
Some stance labels read differently depending on bridge direction. A construct may project into a report-only rendering in one direction while the reverse direction is not lawful at all. Authors should therefore avoid stance prose that sounds symmetric when the bridge card is directional.

#### F.9.1:17.3 - Loss emphasis rule
When a stance is likely to invite over-reading, the loss note should be strengthened rather than softened. The overlay is useful exactly because it helps interpretation; that is also why it can mislead if the losses are understated.

### F.9.1:18 - Bundle Use and Comparative Reading

#### F.9.1:18.1 - Bundle-level reuse
Tradition bundles and viewpoint bundles may reuse the same stance vocabulary across many bridge cards, but the interpretation remains card-local. Bundle reuse is a readability aid, not a warrant that similarly named overlays are structurally equivalent.

#### F.9.1:18.2 - Comparative stance caution
Two bridge cards may both be marked `projection` while dropping very different dimensions. Reviewers should therefore compare the loss notes and source-target structure, not the overlay term alone.

#### F.9.1:18.3 - Boundary to second bridge taxonomy
If authors start grouping bridges primarily by stance label and ignoring bridge kind, direction, `CL`, or loss, they have implicitly created a rival bridge taxonomy. `F.9.1` forbids that drift.

### F.9.1:19 - Review Matrix and Migration Tests

A reviewer can test stance-overlay integrity with five questions:

1. **Is the underlying bridge card complete and still primary?**
2. **Does the overlay stay weaker than the bridge card's structural claims?**
3. **Would the same overlay still be truthful if read in the reverse direction?** If not, the locality or directionality needs to be made clearer.
4. **Do the loss notes carry the interpretive claim that the overlay might otherwise overstate?**
5. **Is the bundle using stance as a readability aid, or as a covert replacement for bridge ontology?**

Legacy prose about things being "really the same", "only a projection", or "just an operational version" should therefore be migrated by recovering bridge kind, direction, `CL`, and loss first, then adding an overlay only if it still adds disciplined interpretive value.
### F.9.1:End
