## C.27 - Temporal Claim Adequacy: State Readings, Temporal Trends, and Intervention-Sensitive Temporal Change


> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**Plain-name.** Temporal claim adequacy.

**Governed object.** C.27 governs authored temporal claims: descriptions in prose, plans, benchmark lines, dashboards, method notes, promises, or explanations that treat state, rate, rhythm, recovery, braking, coasting, redirection, stabilization, or rate-change as sufficient for some use.

**Object/description/carrier discipline.** The described system, work, practice, method, service, or benchmark is not the C.27 record. A `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` is an authored description of temporal-claim adequacy. A document, table, page, report, or card may carry that description; it is not the temporal claim, not the dynamic system, and not the work trace.

**Use-context and basis discipline.** When this pattern says `supportedUse`, it means the decision, plan, diagnosis, comparison, publication, promise, assurance-facing relation, or other practical use that this exact C.27 record can carry given its claim posture, basis, windows, resistance/cost statement, and reopen condition. `unsupportedUse` means a nearby stronger use that this exact record does not carry. These fields do not create permission; they state the pragmatic reach of the authored temporal-claim description.

Bare "support" should not do hidden ontology work in C.27. Use `supportedUse` / `unsupportedUse` only for the pragmatic reach of a temporal-claim record; use `evidence basis`, `model basis`, `source basis`, or `assumption` for the reason a reading is credible; use `operational-support load` for service or operations workload; use `RouteRef` or a named FPF pattern relation when an existing FPF pattern carries the stronger question.

**Boundary-crossing claim use.** The object remains an authored temporal claim. What changes is the use context: the claim is used as citable basis outside the immediate local discussion, published, benchmarked, promised, assured, made durable rationale, repeated in a reusable method description, used in a gate/public dashboard/Part G pack, or carried across context or scale. Casual reuse in a neighboring chat is not enough by itself. Boundary-crossing use is what can require a `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`.

**Use this pattern when** a claim about speed, rhythm, throughput, recovery, convergence, rollout, adoption, braking, coasting, redirection, or stabilization is used to change action and therefore needs effort, window, resistance, basis, supported-use, unsupported-use, and reopen discipline.

**Do not use this pattern when** the temporal wording is ordinary prose, a state/snapshot reading, a rate/trend reading whose measurement construction is enough, a formal `U.Dynamics` model, an actual work trace, a benchmark harness, a service promise, a quality judgement, or a residual quantum-like probe/frame case without an intervention-sensitive temporal claim.

**C.27 in 60 seconds.** Use C.27 only if:

1. temporal wording is used to justify action, comparison, budget, gate, promise, assurance, or an explicit relation to another FPF pattern;
2. the difference between state, rate, and rate-change changes supported use;
3. the text can name at least target, intervention, window, resistance/cost, basis, supported use, and unsupported use or reopen trigger.

Otherwise stop at ordinary prose, a Dyn0 state reading, a Dyn1 rate/trend reading, C.16 measurement discipline, `U.Dynamics` model discipline, or the existing FPF pattern that carries the stronger question.

For local diagnosis or planning, C.27 usually ends with one `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`. Plain references are enough while the use stays local. A local card should normally fit in 5-9 short lines; if it does not, clarify the claim, downgrade, or cite the existing FPF pattern that carries the stronger question. `RouteRef`, `C16RouteRef`, `G9ParityPlanRef`, and similar references appear only when the use is load-bearing beyond the local note.

**Quick refusals.** "Backlog is 120" is Dyn0; no C.27 record. "Backlog fell 20/week" is Dyn1, with C.16 if the measure is load-bearing; no C.27 record unless a rate-change use appears. "This section accelerates orientation" is ordinary prose unless the authored unit uses that acceleration claim as method-effectiveness evidence.

**Dyn2 is not maturity.** Dyn2 classifies the use made of an authored temporal claim, not the system, team, method, or service being described. Higher `DynOrder` is not better; it only says what the authored temporal claim treats as sufficient for supported use.

**Local refresh boundary.** A local card carries only a reopen, downgrade, or pattern-reference condition. G.11, B.3.4, and assurance refresh discipline become relevant only when the temporal claim is public, Part G-facing, assurance-facing, or otherwise durable beyond local planning/diagnosis.

### C.27:1 - Problem frame

FPF already has established constructs and patterns for time, work, resources, measurement,
CharacteristicSpace, dynamics laws, planning, publication, and quantum-like
probe/frame issues. What is missing is a cheap claim-adequacy lens for authored
temporal claims when a state/rate reading is used as if it supplied the basis for a
rate-change, rhythm-change, regime-change, braking, coasting, redirection,
recovery, or stabilization claim.

The first-minute working situation is simple: a manager, method author,
researcher, operator, or agentic-tool planner says that something should speed
up, slow down, converge faster, recover sooner, sustain rhythm, improve
throughput, accelerate learning, brake risk, or redirect effort. FPF should
help the reader ask whether the claim is only a state reading, only a
rate/trajectory reading, or an intervention-sensitive claim about changing a
rate under effort, resistance, rhythm, feedback, constraint, or cost.

What goes wrong if missed: the text measures or names a rate and then behaves
as if it knows how to change that rate. This produces speed-only management,
benchmark theater, hidden promises, causal overclaim, effort-free acceleration,
rhythm-as-vibe, and false QL relevance.

The intended FPF gain is not "add physics metaphors". The gain is a compact
thinking-and-action discipline for cases where speed talk hides effort,
timing, resistance, evidence, scale, reversibility, and supported use.

Anti-case: if a phrase uses speed or rhythm only as ordinary explanatory prose,
or if a state/rate reading is enough for the use, C.27 should be easy not to
use.

Use C.27 because it gives a working reader a useful pause before acting
on speed talk. The intended use is not to formalize every temporal sentence.
The intended use is to stop a small set of expensive mistakes:

- a rate is measured and then treated as if the intervention mechanism is known;
- visible throughput improves while hidden queues, rework, quality loss, or
  burnout worsen;
- a past slope is treated as a future control model;
- a local rate-change is projected across scale without aggregation basis or evidence;
- rhythm or cadence is used as a vibe label with no bearer, anchor, window,
  proxy/evidence, or supported use;
- a planning note becomes a causal/evaluation claim, benchmark result, service promise, or
  assurance claim;
- quantum-like modeling is treated as relevant merely because the text contains discreteness,
  types, probes, tokens, or state-space wording.

The positive reader use compact is short:

1. If the statement is only a state reading, use the ordinary state/evidence
   relation.
2. If the statement is only a rate or trajectory reading, use measurement and
   sampling-window discipline.
3. If the statement claims that effort, policy, input, rhythm, constraint, or
   resistance changes the rate, use the weakest C.27 record that changes use.
4. If the claim crosses the local working boundary into comparison, benchmark,
   publication, gate, assurance, public promise, durable rationale,
   reusable method, formal/control/prediction use, or cross-context transfer,
   strengthen the C.27 record and name the existing patterns that carry the
   specialist claim questions. Local decision-use can often remain a
   `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`.

This is the central anti-bureaucracy invariant: no C.27 record unless the
Dyn0/Dyn1/Dyn2 distinction changes interpretation, decision-use, evidence posture,
resource allocation, benchmark reading, supported use, or reopen trigger.

Dyn2-Affordability: a correct C.27 use leaves less work behind than the ambiguity
would have caused. If applying C.27 creates more work than the temporal
distinction changes, exit.

At the point of use, the C.27 question is concrete. Before adding a C.27
record, recover:

- what rate, rhythm, trajectory, regime, or stability claim is in play;
- whether the text is reading state, reading rate, or claiming rate-change;
- what effort, input, policy, method, intervention actor/role assignment, or resource envelope is supposed
  to change the temporal behavior;
- what resists, delays, stores momentum, introduces lag, or makes reversal
  costly;
- what evidence, trace, assumption, model, or posture supplies the basis for the reading;
- what use the claim can carry and what stronger use remains unsupported;
- when the simplified reading should reopen, downgrade, or cite the fuller
  pattern that carries the stronger question.

The pattern buys practical action, not a vocabulary test. A person can explain
the check as: "A trend is not yet an intervention model; show the effort,
window, resistance, use, and reopen condition, or keep the claim weaker."

Some useful temporal observations arrive before they are claim-ready:


- the team may not only be slow; it may be unable to brake;
- the problem may not be throughput but rhythm mismatch;
- a metric may improve while operational-support load accumulates;
- "the process sped up" may hide orders, invoices, shipments, support tickets,
  PRs, tests, and deployments moving through different paths and interaction
  windows;
- more tool calls may accelerate activity traces without accelerating reasoning
  or repair.

These are temporal-claim adequacy cues, not C.27 records. C.27 should preserve
their weak posture. When the reader suspects a hidden Dyn2 claim question but cannot yet
state target, intervention, window, resistance/cost basis, evidence or
assumption, and supported use, the correct output is a partly-said material cue held through A.16, A.16.1, B.4.1, or B.5.2.0, with possible later C.27 record.

The cue may become a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` only when a rate-change,
rhythm-change, braking, coasting, recovery, stabilization, or intervention
claim becomes explicit enough to name the card minimum. If the live question is
not temporal-claim adequacy, use the pattern that carries that question: C.16
for measurement, C.26 for residual QL cue, E.17.AUD for authored-unit drift, or
viability/assurance patterns when the weak observation is actually about staying
inside a viability or assurance boundary.



### C.27:2 - Problem

C.27 governs the adequacy of intervention-sensitive temporal claims.

C.27 does not govern:

- transition laws or reusable dynamics models, which `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` carries;
- state-space or coordinate construction, which `A.19` and `C.16` carry;
- measurement legality, evidence construction, provenance, assurance posture,
  or evidence decay, which `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `B.3.4`, and `G.6` carry as
  applicable;
- work actuals and resource burn, which `U.Work` and `Gamma_work` carry;
- planning structures and authorized work, which `U.WorkPlan`,
  `U.MethodDescription`, `C.24`, and relevant planning patterns carry;
- autonomy-budget declarations, guard checks, ledgers, depletion, pause/resume,
  or freedom-of-action governance, which `E.16` carries;
- lifecycle/evolution loops or language-state movement, which `A.4`, `B.4`,
  `A.16`, and `B.4.1` carry;
- causal/evaluation claim, which causal/evaluation/evidence patterns carry;
- metric proxy/value substitution, which `E.13` carries;
- service promises, agreement text, SLA-like statements, release gates, public
  commitments, and service-acceptance bindings, which `A.2.3`, `A.2.8`,
  `A.2.9`, `A.6.C`, `F.12`, and assurance patterns carry;
- benchmark harnesses, which `G.9` carries;
- dashboard time-series, telemetry pins, path/slice publication, pack shipping,
  discipline-health slots, and refresh orchestration, which `C.21`, `G.12`,
  `G.6`, `G.10`, and `G.11` carry;
- selector publication roles, which `G.5` carries only when a concrete
  selector-publication case consumes a dynamic benchmark result;
- quantum-like probe/frame/export/coarsening residues, which `C.26` carries;
- publication roles, MVPK faces, governed objects of related FPF patterns, or Kernel `U.*` kinds.

Dynamic-order labels are pattern-local claim classifications, not FPF kinds.
C.27 does not mint `U.Force`, `U.Mass`, `U.Acceleration`,
`U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, or `U.SecondOrderProcess`.

FPF gains a compact discipline for claims that otherwise hide behind words such
as speed, agility, throughput, adoption, rhythm, velocity, convergence,
debugging speed, service recovery, faster improvement, acceleration, braking,
redirection, or cadence.

The main failure to prevent is:

> A text measures or names a rate and then behaves as if it knows how to change
> that rate.

C.27 should make three distinctions cheap:

- `Dyn0`: state or snapshot reading;
- `Dyn1`: rate, trend, trajectory, flow, throughput, tempo, or cadence
  reading;
- `Dyn2`: intervention-sensitive temporal reading: rate-change, regime
  transition, braking, redirection, coasting, pause, stabilization, rhythm fit,
  effort profile, resistance, inertia, policy effect, feedback, uncertainty, or
  constraint handling.

C.27 protects against the managerial speed cult. Faster is
not the default value. Braking, pausing, stabilizing, redirecting, coasting,
delaying, widening before narrowing, or slowing rollout can be the correct C.27
outcome.

Local temporal-value boundary:

> C.27 can classify the temporal move. It does not decide that acceleration,
> braking, stabilization, coasting, recovery, convergence, or release speed is
> valuable. The FPF patterns for value alignment, assurance, promise, ethics,
> safety, legal, or proxy/audit concerns carry value, utility, constraint fit,
> harm, promise impact, and proxy distortion.

This boundary applies to claims such as "faster onboarding is better", "more
throughput is better", "faster convergence is better", or "rapid release is our
goal". C.27 may make the temporal claim adequate enough to inspect, but it does
not turn speed into value by default.

These are claim-relation boundary tests, not keyword exclusions. C.27 may still supply a
short temporal-claim note when the state/rate/rate-change/rhythm/regime reading
changes supported use. The named neighbouring pattern then carries the
non-C.27 question. If the temporal distinction does not change supported use, exit
C.27 completely.

Do not make C.27 the governing pattern when:

- the text only reports a state or snapshot and no rate/use distinction changes
  interpretation;
- the text only reports a rate, trend, throughput, cadence, or trajectory and no
  intervention-sensitive rate-change claim is made;
- a word such as speed, rhythm, acceleration, agility, or inertia is only a
  teaching metaphor or casual Plain wording;
- the live issue is authored-unit drift: one overloaded local head, drifting
  primary object of talk, bounded comparison, explanation faithfulness, or
  approval/action wording should use E.17.AUD, E.17.ID.CR, E.17.EFP, or the
  pattern that governs the stronger use before C.27;
- the live question is whether a measure is legal, comparable, or interpretable:
  `C.16` carries measurement construction, with C.27 only citing the temporal
  C.27 relation if the measure supplies evidence for an intervention-sensitive claim;
- the live question is a transition law, simulation, prediction, or control model:
  `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` and formal/evidence patterns carry the formal dynamics,
  with C.27 only naming the supported-use limit of the authored claim;
- the live question is work/resource actuals: `U.Work` and `Gamma_work` carry the
  evidence, with C.27 only using it as effort basis for a Dyn2 claim;
- the live question is scaling-law or elasticity adequacy: C.18.1 carries scale
  variables, scale window, scale probes, and elasticity posture, with C.27
  only naming the temporal-claim adequacy question if scale change is used as the basis for
  rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization;
- the live question is a work plan, call plan, method description, or authorized
  intervention actor/role assignment: the planning pattern carries the plan, with C.27 only active
  when the plan's supported use depends on rate-change, recovery, stabilization,
  or braking;
- the live question is task-family specialization: C.22.1 carries adaptation
  signature fields, with C.27 only naming the temporal-claim question when
  learning/adaptation speed changes supported use;
- the live question is preserving a viability envelope under disturbance,
  adaptation cost, latency, operational-support load, or boundary regulation: C.26.3 carries
  the envelope claim, with C.27 only naming the temporal move if
  braking, throttling, cadence change, recovery timing, or stabilization changes
  supported use;
- the live question is causal attribution: causal, evaluation, and evidence
  patterns carry causal/evaluation claim; C.27 may mark the temporal claim's causal
  use as unsupported until that pattern relation is satisfied;
- the live question is a benchmark, budget, promise, service boundary, SLA-like
  statement, public commitment, assurance, or release gate: the relevant
  benchmark, boundary, promise, service, assurance, or planning pattern carries
  that claim/use, with C.27 only naming the temporal claim that the other pattern
  inspects;
- the live question is residual quantum-like probe/frame/export/coarsening cue:
  `C.26` carries it only after ordinary dynamics, work, measurement, benchmark,
  proxy, and assurance patterns have carried their parts.

Overlap example: "Adding review capacity for two sprints will double backlog
reduction rate and justify a budget increase" is not solved by C.27 alone. C.27
types the Dyn2 temporal-claim question; the planning pattern carries planned effort,
`C.16` carries the rate/rate-change measure, the budget/planning pattern carries
approval, and causal/evaluation patterns carry any causal/evaluation claim. The short
temporal-claim note is a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`: it prevents those
patterns from missing the hidden rate-change question, but it does not replace
them.

C.27 does not introduce:

- literal Newtonian or physical ontology for organizations, practices, services,
  dances, learning, or workflows;
- physical quantum ontology or quantum-like superiority;
- mandatory ODE/PDE/calculus formalism for all temporal claims;
- new Kernel types for force, mass, acceleration, rhythm, or practice;
- a new publication role, separate pattern, law sheet, or MVPK face;
- default C.27 profiling for every temporal word;
- thin C.27 echo records when a local C.27 card or profile can cite the FPF
  pattern that carries the stronger question.


### C.27:3 - Forces


The source article contributes three practical ideas that should survive into
C.27 prose.

First, the useful question is an effort-profile question, not a derivative-word
question. In management, learning, tool-use, incident response, practice
transfer, dance, and service operations, the relevant change is often a profile
of effort over windows: impulse, scheduled push, feedback policy, adaptive
regime, brake, pause, coast, or redirect. C.27 should preserve effort over time,
not just a scalar acceleration label.

Second, rhythm is interval-structured. A rhythm claim needs an anchor, bearer,
window, evidence proxy or observation basis, and supported use. "Rhythm" as mood
or vibe is not enough; it must be possible to recover whose rhythm, across which
intervals, by which observation or proxy, and for which decision. Coupling,
phase, synchronization, or entrainment-like wording is only needed when the
claim depends on a relation between bearers.

Third, useful formalization improves replicable practice code. C.27 should help
make a practice transferable by recording effort windows, rhythm anchors,
bearer, resistance proxy, evidence basis, and reopen condition. It should not force
equations merely because the source analogy used dynamics language.

Borrowed-frame translation:

| Borrowed idea | C.27 use |
| --- | --- |
| State / rate / rate-change distinction | Adopted as Dyn0/Dyn1/Dyn2 claim-reading discipline. |
| Effort windows, acceleration, braking, redirection, coasting, recovery, and stabilization | Adopted as the central temporal-claim adequacy question, with acceleration bias explicitly rejected. |
| Time-scale plurality: spot, episode, sprint, lifecycle, learning-cycle, technoevolution, lifetime, or domain-local time scale | Adapted as optional `temporalScalePosture` for boundary-crossing rhythm use, practice, learning, lifecycle, or evolution claims; not mandatory for ordinary local cards. |
| Speed as result of effort/input/resistance rather than explanation of its own future change | Adopted as the rate-as-cause-of-rate-change anti-pattern: observed speed does not by itself explain how to change speed. |
| Rhythm as interval-structured effort/rate-change pattern | Adopted with bearer, anchor, window, basis/proxy, supported use, and stronger coupling only when cross-bearer relation is live. |
| Dance/practice style as replicable temporal code | Adapted as replicable practice-description basis: if a training rhythm, review cadence, learning routine, or practice style is meant for boundary-crossing use, name what rhythm/effort pattern is transmitted, which bearer carries it, which anchor/window makes it reproducible, and what error accumulates if only static poses or rate words are transmitted. |
| Typed/discretized compact dynamic representation | A.19, C.16, and C.26 carry it only when the representation, measurement, or residual QL cue is live. |
| Quantum-like or active-inference superiority claim | Not adopted in C.27; C.26 carries the residual probe/frame/order/export/coarsening claim after ordinary C.27/C.16/work/benchmark/proxy pattern relations are named. |
| Universal search for force/mass analogues everywhere | Rejected as literal ontology; physical words may remain Plain diagnostic cues, but C.27 mints no `U.Force`, `U.Mass`, `U.Acceleration`, `U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, or `U.SecondOrderProcess`. |

| Design alternative | C.27 outcome | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Do nothing | Insufficient | Leaves FPF vulnerable to speed-only, rate-only, rhythm-as-vibe, and effort-free intervention claims. |
| Add examples only | Insufficient | Examples would not create a reusable adequacy lens or pattern-relation discipline. |
| Put the whole question in `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` | Wrong governed object | `U.Dynamics` governs transition law/model, not the cross-pattern recognition and escalation lens. |
| Put the whole question in `C.16` | Wrong governed object | Measurement construction is necessary but does not govern effort windows, planning, inertia proxies, promises, or intervention adequacy. |
| Put the whole question in `C.24` | Too narrow | Agentic tool-use is one application, not the general pattern for temporal claim adequacy. |
| Put the whole question in `C.26` | Wrong residual QL relation | This would make quantum-like modeling relevant too early; C.26 remains residual for probe/frame/export/coarsening cues. |
| Add new Kernel types such as `U.Force`, `U.Mass`, `U.Acceleration`, `U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, or `U.SecondOrderProcess` | Wrong ontology | The repeated value is a claim-adequacy lens, not a stable Kernel ontology. |
| Create a new publication role or separate pattern for C.27 cards | Wrong object kind | Dyn2 temporal-claim records are pattern-local records, not publication roles or separate patterns. |
| Use C.27 with explicit references to the FPF patterns that carry stronger questions | Chosen C.27 shape | One C-pattern can govern the adequacy lens while preserving measurement, dynamics-law, work, benchmark, promise, quality, viability, and QL relations in the patterns that carry them. |
| Duplicate C.27 claim-adequacy content across every related pattern | Too broad | Broad distribution would make ordinary temporal wording expensive. A C.27 card or profile cites the FPF pattern that carries the stronger question instead of creating a duplicate temporal record. |


### C.27:4 - Solution


Use the weakest dynamic-order output that changes the use. Dyn0 and Dyn1 are readings in ordinary prose, not C.27 record classes; C.27 records start only when a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` for boundary-crossing claim use is needed.

| Level | User-visible move | Stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Skip** | Leave as ordinary prose | temporal wording does not change claim/use |
| **Dyn0 reading** | state/snapshot only | snapshot is enough |
| **Dyn1 reading** | rate/trend/trajectory only, or C.16-compatible measure when load-bearing | no intervention-sensitive claim |
| **Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard** | one-screen `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` | local plan, diagnostic, rhythm, effort, or intervention clarity is enough |
| **Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile** | `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` with active profile blocks only | the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context, is published, benchmarked, promised, assured, made durable rationale, repeated in a reusable method description, used in a gate/public dashboard/Part G pack, or carried across context/scale |
| **Formal-model relation** | C.27 states the temporal-claim question and cites the pattern that carries the formal claim | reusable law, simulation, prediction, control, calibrated model, or assurance-bearing comparison is claimed |

A Dyn2 classification is not evidence that a `U.Dynamics` model exists. It is
only evidence that the authored claim is using temporal change in a way that may
need a dynamics pattern relation if stronger use is claimed.

Normativity follows boundary-crossing use:

- normative when the claim carries decision, gate, budget, benchmark,
  publication, assurance, public promise, or reusable method;
- advisory when the claim is exploratory, abductive, or early planning;
- informative when the pattern teaches examples, vocabulary, or anti-patterns.

This is the ordinary first-minute reader-facing form and the main visible C.27 record
for ordinary C.27 use. It remains anchored to an authored claim rather than
becoming a free-standing consulting card.

```text
Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard

claimText / claimRef:
  What sentence, claim, plan line, benchmark line, or promise-like wording is being read?

target:
  What rate, rhythm, regime, recovery, trajectory, or stability reading is being changed?

move:
  accelerate | decelerate | brake | redirect | coast | pause |
  stabilize | recover | sustain | widen | narrow | domain-local

intervention:
  What effort, input, policy, method, resource, tool-use change, or action is supposed to change it?

window:
  Over what claim / sampling / effort / rhythm / validity window?

resistanceOrCost:
  What resists, delays, stores momentum, creates residue, or makes the change costly?

basis:
  What evidence, trace, model, assumption, or diagnostic judgement supplies the basis for this reading?

basisPosture?:
  assumption | observedTrace | measured | modelled | diagnostic |
  planning | benchmark-referenced | causal/evaluation-referenced |
  promise/assurance-referenced | unknown

supportedUse:
  What decision, plan, diagnosis, comparison, or pattern relation can this record carry?

unsupportedUse / reopen:
  What stronger use is unsupported, and what would reopen, downgrade, or add a pattern reference to this claim?
```

Window default: for a local card, one `window` line may stand for claim, sampling,
effort, rhythm, and validity when the distinction does not change supported use.
Split windows only when evidence is sampled over a different interval than the
claim, effort or intervention occurs over a different interval than the outcome,
benchmark baseline/adaptation/follow-up windows differ, the rhythm anchor/window
differs from the measurement window, or validity/refresh depends on a separate
freshness window.

Optional `basisPosture?` is the card-level bridge to profile posture. It says how
strong the local basis is without making the card a full profile. When the claim
later crosses a boundary, `basisPosture?` helps choose the matching
`dynClaimPosture`; it does not strengthen the claim by itself.

`claimText / claimRef` keeps C.27 tethered to an authored unit and source. `target`
separates the bearer/reading from the intervention, so "we accelerate the team"
gets repaired into a rate/rhythm/trajectory question. `move` protects against
acceleration bias: braking, pausing, stabilization, recovery, coasting,
widening, and narrowing are also Dyn2 moves when they change supported use.

If the author cannot answer these in short lines, the correct repair is usually
to clarify the claim, not to escalate immediately to a full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`.

Compact C.27 rhythm-claim discipline:

```text
dyn2RhythmClaimBlock? / Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard fields:
  rhythmBearerRef : whose or what rhythm?
  rhythmAnchor : beat | cadence | cycle | sprint | epoch | release train | attention window | domain-local anchor
  rhythmWindowRef : over what interval?
  instrumentProxyOrEvidenceRef? : trace | proxy | observation | measurement reference
  supportedUse : what decision or reading this record can carry
  couplingMode? : only when cross-bearer synchronization, phase relation, dependency, coordination, or entrainment-like practice relation is claimed
  validityWindowRef? : only when the rhythm reading is used beyond the immediate working window
```

Cadence as observed interval rate may be Dyn1. Rhythm becomes Dyn2 only when
interval structure, effort pattern, coordination, recovery, stabilization, or
intervention-sensitive use changes supported use.

This discipline keeps rhythm connected to a dynamic claim. A plain "release cadence" or "workshop rhythm" does not need phase or entrainment language unless the supported use depends on a relation between bearers. If the rhythm wording does not change a rate, intervention, recovery, coordination, or supported-use reading, it should remain ordinary prose rather than make C.27 relevant.

Compact C.27 coasting-claim discipline:

```text
dyn2CoastingClaimBlock? / Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard fields:
  coastingClaim : movement, stability, adoption, quality change, queue drain, operational-support load, or practice persistence continues after effort changes or stops
  coastingBasis : habit | automation | stored work | queue pressure | learned capability | commitment momentum | social norm | physical inertia | unknown
  coastingWindowRef : over what interval after effort changes or stops?
  supportedUse : what decision, plan, diagnosis, comparison, or local practice reading this record can carry
  unsupportedUse : what stronger use this coasting reading does not support
  reopenTrigger : what change, decay, stall, reversal, hidden cost, or new evidence reopens the claim
```

Coasting becomes a full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` block only when a promise,
gate, assurance, benchmark, cross-scale transfer, or public comparison depends
on continued movement or stability after effort changes or stops. Local cases
such as adoption continuing after incentives stop, quality degrading after
acceleration stops, operational-support load continuing after rollout, a trained practice
persisting after training, or a queue draining after intervention ends usually
need only the card fields above.

Coasting/debt fork:

- Use `dyn2CoastingClaimBlock?` when supported use depends on continued
  movement, stability, adoption, queue drain, practice persistence, or
  operational-support load after effort changes or stops.
- Use `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` when supported use depends on residue,
  reversibility, hidden cost, delayed damage, repayment, braking, or recovery
  plan.
- If both are live, coasting describes continued motion or stability; debt and
  hysteresis describe what remains and how costly reversal or recovery is.

**Rare boundary-crossing escalation.** Use the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` only for authored temporal claims used beyond the local working context. It is a pattern-local authored temporal-claim adequacy record, not a model of the dynamic system itself, not a publication role, not a Part G record, not an MVPK face, and not the default C.27 record.

Read the profile-block menu only when boundary-crossing use is already live. The list below is a pattern-relation menu, not a form. The absence of an inactive block is normal; it is not a missing field.

The shape is a header plus present profile blocks. The header carries the minimum boundary-crossing claim-use posture. Each block should be read from its applicability sentence first, and a block appears only when `supportedUse` relies on that claim relation. These blocks are not fields of one universal dynamic object; they are different evidence descriptions and pattern relations made relevant by supported use.

Profile-block closure rule: every present block is either defined by C.27,
a pattern-reference-only block that cites the existing FPF pattern carrying the
stronger question and adds no new C.27 object, or absent from `activeBlocks`.
A block name is not a new governed object.

Active-block naming rule: read each `activeBlocks` name by one of three statuses.
`localAdequacyBlock` means C.27 states local adequacy fields for an authored
temporal claim. `patternReferenceOnly` means C.27 states only the temporal
move/window/supported-use boundary and cites the FPF pattern that carries the
stronger question. `relationOnly` means the concern appears in relations or
examples but not as an active block. `dyn2PromiseBoundaryRoute?`,
`dyn2HighStakesTemporalMoveRoute?`, and `dyn2PolicyTransferRoute?` are
pattern-reference-only by default; `dyn2PolicyTransferRoute?` is folded into
`dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` when behavior-policy/evaluation-policy transfer is
load-bearing.

}
```

Absence of an inactive block is normal. It is not a missing field. A block
becomes active only when the supported use relies on it; otherwise the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`
should stay smaller or downgrade to a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, Dyn1 reading, or ordinary prose.

Pattern-reference-only blocks:

- `dyn2PolicyTransferRoute?` is handled inside `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` when
  behavior-policy/evaluation-policy or off-policy transfer is load-bearing. C.27
  names `behaviorPolicyRef`, `proposedPolicyRef`, `offPolicyRisk`, and the
  evaluation/control pattern relation; it does not create a separate policy-transfer
  pattern.
- `dyn2PromiseBoundaryRoute?` states only the temporal move, window,
  supported use, unsupported stronger use, and references to the patterns that
  carry promise, commitment, instituting speech act, service acceptance,
  contract unpacking, and assurance: `A.2.3`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, `A.6.C`,
  `F.12`, and assurance patterns.
- `dyn2HighStakesTemporalMoveRoute?` states only the high-stakes temporal move, window,
  unsupported stronger use, and reference to the pattern that carries the harm,
  quality, safety, ethics, legal, financial, operational-support, or
  human-wellbeing question.

Header discipline: for a `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` for boundary-crossing claim use, `claimRef`,
`describedEntityRef`, `dynClaimPosture`, `dynOrder`, `claimWindowRef`,
`supportedUse`, `unsupportedUse`, and `reopenTrigger` are mandatory.
`temporalBearerRef` is present when the temporal bearer differs from the
described entity or is otherwise load-bearing. `profileCarrierRef` is present
when publication or evidence needs the authored carrier named. `baseCharacteristicRef`
is mandatory only when measurement, comparison, or C.16 relation is load-bearing; for a Plain diagnostic claim it may remain a local phrase in the `target` line.

Window split rule: one local window is enough only when the claim window,
sampling window, effort/intervention window, validity window, baseline window,
and follow-up window are the same for the supported use. Split them when the
evidence is sampled over a different interval than the claim, effort is applied
before or after the measured change, a comparison needs a baseline, an outcome is
observed after exposure, or the claim remains valid only for a shorter period
than the historical trace. If the split is unknown and the supported use depends
on it, downgrade the use or add the relevant window reference before relying on
the temporal claim.

C.16 rate-measurement relation: when rate or rate-change is load-bearing, C.27
cites the C.16 measurement relation. C.27 does not define measurement
legality.

```text
c16RateMeasurementRouteRef? {
  baseCharacteristicRef
  stateMeasureRef?
  rateMeasureRef?
  rateChangeReadingMeasureRef?
  DHCMethodRef?
  samplingWindowRef
  scaleUnitPolarityRef?
  evidenceStubRefs?
  stabilityOrNoisePosture?
  C16RouteRef
}
```

C.27 effort/work block: when a rate-change claim depends on effort, resource,
method, intervention actor, or role-assignment capacity, C.27 separates planned
effort, method description, resource envelope, actual work trace, and
authority/capability posture. It does not turn work evidence into a dynamics law.

```text
dyn2EffortWorkBlock? {
  interventionRef?
  plannedEffortRef?        // WorkPlan / MethodDescription / resource envelope
  actualEffortTraceRef?    // U.Work / Gamma_work evidence
  effortWindowRef?
  interventionActorRef? {
    actorOrRoleAssignmentRef
    authorityPosture: authorized | proposed | hypothetical | unknown
    capabilityOrScopeRef?
  }
  resourceEnvelopeRef?
  A15RouteRef?
}
```

`interventionActorRef` means the actor, role assignment, tool, system, policy
rule, or human/work arrangement claimed to apply the intervention, plus an
authority/capability posture. If a planning claim says "add review capacity", C.27
should make it visible whether that capacity is assigned, capable, available,
authorized, proposed, hypothetical, or unknown, while leaving role/method/work
alignment to A.15 and work patterns.

C.27 resistance/inertia block: `dyn2ResistanceInertiaBlock?` is present when supported use depends on what resists, delays, stores momentum, creates residue, or makes the change costly. This is core C.27 content because it prevents effort-free acceleration claims. The `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` asks the question locally; the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` uses a separate active profile block only when that answer matters beyond the local working context.

```text
dyn2ResistanceInertiaBlock? {
  resistanceOrInertiaProxy
  resistanceProxyFamily
  resistanceProxyBasisPosture: qualitative | measured | modelled | assumed | unknown
  evidenceRef?
  unsupportedUse?
}
```

`resistanceProxyBasisPosture = unknown` is an acceptable C.27 result. Unknown resistance need not
block a local diagnostic `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, but it should block durable
acceleration, causal, benchmark, promise-like, or assurance use until stronger
evidence basis or carrying pattern reference is supplied.

C.27 control/policy relation: `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` is present only when `dynClaimPosture` is `controlModel`, `policyRule`, `adaptive`, a feedback-bearing `planningModel`, or an explicit C.24/C.19/evaluation relation. This relation says that the authored temporal claim has crossed into control/policy model or policy-evaluation use. It does not make C.27 an MPC, reinforcement-learning, or policy-evaluation pattern.

```text
dyn2ControlPolicyRoute? {
  interventionRegime
  controlHorizon?
  closedLoopUpdate?
  behaviorPolicyRef?
  proposedPolicyRef?
  offPolicyRisk?
  stopRule?
  controlPolicyRouteRef -> U.Dynamics / C.19 / C.24 / evaluation pattern
}
```

C.27 causal-use relation: `dyn2CausalUseRoute?` is present only when the authored temporal claim uses a rate-change, intervention, effort, workshop, policy, or practice change as a causal-use basis. Core rule: C.27 can say a claim is Dyn2 and intervention-sensitive; C.27 cannot turn that basis into a causal/evaluation claim with estimand and identification/evaluation relation.

```text
dyn2CausalUseRoute? {
  interventionRef
  comparatorOrCounterfactualRef
  timeZeroOrAssignmentWindow
  followUpWindowRef
  outcomeMeasureRef
  estimand?
  assumptions?
  rivalCauses?
  identificationOrEvaluationDesignRef?
  supportedCausalUse
  unsupportedCausalUse
}
```

C.27 dynamic benchmark requirement: `dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock?` is present only when a comparison or benchmark depends on rate, rate-change, recovery speed, rhythm improvement, intervention effect, effort budget, or dynamic outcome. Content rule: C.27 declares the dynamic claim question of the benchmark; `G.9` carries parity.

```text
dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock? {
  comparedClaimRefs
  dynOrderCompared: Dyn1 | Dyn2
  baselineWindowRef
  adaptationOrInterventionWindowRef?
  budgetOrEffortParityRef?
  rateOrRateChangeReadingMeasureRef?
  G9ParityPlanRef
  G9ParityReportRef?
}
```

C.27 metric-target effect block: `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` is present only
when metric publication, target use, incentive use, dashboard use, gate use, or
public comparison changes temporal behavior or supported use. C.16 carries the
measure; E.13, assurance, or governance patterns carry proxy/utility distortion;
C.26 is relevant only if residual probe/frame/order/export cue remains.

```text
dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock? {
  publishedOrTargetedMeasureRef
  targetOrIncentiveUse
  dashboardGatePromiseOrBudgetUse?
  behaviorChangeRisk
  temporalWorkChangeVsMeasurementChangeNote
  C16RouteRef?
  E13ProxyAuditRef?
  C26RouteRef? // only if residual probe/frame/order/export cue remains
}
```

C.27 object-centric trace block: `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` is present only
when a workflow/process rate claim depends on several object bearers, event
traces, interactions, or aggregation basis rather than one scalar speed label.
C.27 records why scalar throughput is insufficient; object-centric process
mining or local process evidence carries the detailed log discipline.

```text
dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock? {
  bearerKind: single-object | multi-object | aggregate | proxy
  objectTypeRefs
  eventTraceRef
  interactionOrCouplingNote?
  convergenceDivergenceRisk?
  aggregationRoute?
  supportedUse
  unsupportedUse
}
```

C.27 cross-scale transfer field: `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` is present only when a dynamic claim transfers rate, rate-change, rhythm, recovery, acceleration, braking, or agility from one bearer/level/aggregate to another. Aggregate rate-change and local rate-change are different readings unless aggregation basis and bearer continuity are declared.

```text
dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock? {
  sourceBearerRef
  targetBearerRef
  aggregationRoute?
  mixShiftRisk?
  dynamicTransferPosture
}
```

C.27 scale-variable claim block: `dyn2ScaleVariableClaimBlock?` is present only when the
authored temporal claim says that changing a resource or scale variable changes
rate, improvement, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization. This is
not the same as cross-scale transfer: scale-variable claim asks which variable is
changed and over what scale window; cross-scale transfer asks whether a dynamic
reading is carried across bearer, level, or aggregate. C.18.1 carries scale
variables, scale windows, scale probes, and elasticity posture; C.27 records
only that the scale change is being used as the basis for a temporal-claim reading.

```text
dyn2ScaleVariableClaimBlock? {
  scaleVariableRef
  scaleWindowRef?
  scaleElasticityPosture: rising | knee | flat | declining | unknown
  C18_1RouteRef?
  G9ParityPlanRef?
}
```

C.27 task-family adaptation relation: `dyn2TaskFamilyAdaptationRoute?` is present
only when the temporal claim says that a holder, dyad, team, specialist
portfolio, method, or agent reaches usable specialization faster on one declared
`TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`. C.22.1 carries the task-family adaptation
signature. C.27 records only the learning/adaptation-rate question and the
supported use that made it relevant.

```text
dyn2TaskFamilyAdaptationRoute? {
  TaskFamilyRef?
  TaskSignature?
  thresholdOrUsableSpecializationRef?
  timeToThresholdRef?
  budgetToThresholdRef?
  C22_1RouteRef
}
```

C.27 viability-envelope relation: `dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRoute?` is present only when
a temporal claim says braking, slowing rollout, throttling, cadence change,
recovery timing, adaptation cost, operational-support load, or stabilization keeps a
viability bearer inside usable bounds. C.27 may type the temporal move and its
window. C.26.3 carries the viability-envelope claim: protected promise or
function, viable bounds, disturbance, sensor/probe/action split, adaptation
cost, and failure mode. Do not make C.27 the pattern for all "stability through
change" claims.

```text
dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRoute? {
  viabilityBearerRef?
  protectedPromiseOrFunctionRef?
  temporalMoveRef?
  C26_3RouteRef
}
```

C.27 residual QL relation: `dyn2QLResidualRoute?` is present only when ordinary FPF
patterns have already carried the temporal-claim, measurement, work, benchmark,
value/proxy, scale, adaptation, viability, promise, or evidence basis and a
residual probe/frame/order/export/coarsening cue still changes the lawful
reading. C.26 carries the residual QL reading. C.27 only records that the authored
temporal claim has a residual QL relation; this block stays hidden by default when
no such residue exists.

```text
dyn2QLResidualRoute? {
  residualQLCue?
  residualQLRouteRef?
  ordinaryRouteBasisRef?
  C26RouteRef
}
```

C.27 debt/hysteresis block: `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` is present only when supported use depends on sustained acceleration, braking, recovery, stabilization, domain residue after effort changes, or a public promise/gate/assurance/high-stakes decision about rate-change. Unknown reversibility is allowed, but it bounds supported use.

```text
dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock? {
  debtKind?
  debtWindowRef?
  evidenceRef?
  reversibilityPosture: reversible | costlyToReverse | irreversibleWithinWindow | unknown
  hysteresisOrResidue?
  repaymentOrBrakePlan?
  debtHysteresisRouteRef -> planning / assurance / quality / wellbeing / safety pattern
}
```

These C.27 dynamic-claim profile-block field definitions are boundary-crossing
material for `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` and for stronger authored temporal
claims used beyond the local working context. They are not the default C.27 user
interface, not a data model, and not a universal C.27 dynamic-claim field list
that every user must fill.


C.27 uses physical words only as Plain analogies. Tech prose uses effort,
input, and work references rather than force; resistance/inertia proxies rather
than mass; rate-change readings rather than acceleration as a new kind; and
rhythm bearer/anchor/window rather than `U.Rhythm`.

Each field-definition item either carries a small local C.27 temporal-claim adequacy value or points
back to the existing FPF pattern that governs the referenced object. A field name
is not a pattern.
Metric, process, service, practice, policy, harm, operational-support, and envelope wording
does not create a free C.27 slot. It must resolve to a local C.27 value, an
existing FPF object reference, or a governing-pattern relation; otherwise it remains
Plain example language.

| Field/question | Definition | Kind discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| claimText / claimRef | The sentence, claim, plan line, benchmark line, or promise-like wording being read. | Anchors C.27 to an authored claim/source; not a free-standing consulting card. |
| target | The temporal reading whose adequacy is in question: rate, cadence, flow, convergence, recovery, narrowing, widening, stabilization, regime, or trajectory. | Local description plus `baseCharacteristicRef` or measurement relation when load-bearing. |
| move | The temporal move: accelerate, decelerate, brake, redirect, coast, pause, stabilize, recover, sustain, widen, narrow, or domain-local. | Prevents acceleration-only bias; braking, pausing, recovery, and coasting can be positive Dyn2 moves. |
| effort, input, policy, method, or intervention | The planned or claimed source of rate-change. It may be work, method change, policy rule, resource input, tool-use change, or control action. | References planning, work, method, policy, or control patterns; it is not stored as a new force object. |
| window | The time interval over which the claim is made, effort is applied, rate is sampled, rhythm is observed, or validity is asserted. | Use a time/window reference appropriate to the pattern; do not collapse all windows into `U.Dynamics.timeBase`. |
| resistance, delay, momentum, or cost | The reason rate-change is not free or immediate: constraint, lag, habit, queue pressure, coordination cost, technical debt, operational-support load, friction, or domain-local resistance proxy. | Domain-local proxy, not literal mass; evidence or assumption should be named when the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context. |
| evidence or assumption | The basis that makes the `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` more than a slogan: observed trace, measurement, work evidence, model assumption, planning assumption, or diagnostic judgement. | Cites C.16, work/evidence, causal, benchmark, or assurance patterns when stronger use is claimed. |
| basisPosture? | Optional compact basis kind: assumption, observed trace, measured, modelled, diagnostic, planning, benchmark-referenced, causal/evaluation-referenced, promise/assurance-referenced, or unknown. | Bridges a local card to `dynClaimPosture` if the claim later becomes boundary-crossing; it does not strengthen the claim by itself. |
| supported decision or use | The practical use that this `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` can carry: orientation, plan choice, budget, benchmark, gate, replan, publication, or local diagnosis. | Must stay no stronger than evidence and `dynClaimPosture`. |
| unsupported stronger use | A nearby use that this `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` cannot carry, such as causal/evaluation claim, release approval, public promise, cross-context transfer, benchmark superiority, or service guarantee. | Prevents laundering a light `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` into a stronger C.27 temporal-claim record. |
| reopen, downgrade, or pattern-reference condition | A condition that requires revisiting the `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, downgrading to Dyn0/Dyn1, escalating to a profile/formal pattern, or citing another pattern. | This is an evolvability trigger, not a status note. |
| rhythmBearerRef | The entity, practice, workflow, service, learner, body part, system component, or other existing FPF object whose rhythm is described. | Must resolve to an existing FPF object or explicitly remain Plain example language; C.27 does not mint a new rhythm kind. |
| rhythmAnchor | The temporal reference for a rhythm claim: beat, cadence, cycle, sprint, epoch, release train, attention window, or domain-local anchor. | It is an anchor for interpretation, not `U.Rhythm`. |
| rhythmWindowRef | The time window across which rhythm is asserted or measured. | Separate from claim, sampling, effort, and validity windows when they differ. |
| instrumentProxyOrEvidenceRef | The measurement or observation proxy used for rhythm, such as tapping task, cadence log, work trace, event sequence, survey, sensor, or domain evidence reference. | Routes to C.16/evidence discipline when load-bearing. |
| couplingMode | How rhythm in one bearer or signal is related to another: synchronization, phase relation, dependency, coordination, entrainment-like practice relation, or domain-local coupling. | Active only when cross-bearer relation is claimed; otherwise ordinary cadence does not need coupling language. |
| validityWindowRef | The period or condition under which the rhythm reading is valid. | Prevents stale rhythm claims from boundary-crossing indefinitely. |

Claim posture discipline: in `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`, `dynClaimPosture` is a
pattern-relation declaration, not a maturity scale. A `diagnosticReading` does not mature
into a `causalClaim` by adding fields; causal/evaluation patterns carry causal
claim posture. A `planningModel` does not become `promiseBoundaryUse` by
publication; promise, boundary, commitment, service, or assurance patterns carry
promise-like posture. Changing posture may change the governing relation, pattern,
evidence basis, or assurance-facing relation.
No C.27 field completion auto-strengthens the posture; stronger posture is a
relation change.




| Field | Definition | Kind discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| claimRef | The authored claim, sentence, plan line, benchmark line, or promise-like wording that the profile for boundary-crossing claim use describes. | Mandatory; anchors the profile to authored temporal-claim content. |
| describedEntityRef | The entity, work object, system, practice, service, method, or other governed object whose temporal claim is being described. | Reference to an existing FPF object; not the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` itself. |
| temporalBearerRef | The object that bears the rate, rhythm, regime, trajectory, or rate-change. It may differ from the described entity in aggregate or proxy cases. | Use only when bearer distinction matters; avoid loose `carrierOrSubject`. |
| profileCarrierRef | The document, card, profile, report, benchmark record, or other authored carrier that contains the Dyn2 claim record. | Carrier of the description, not the dynamic system. |
| dynClaimPosture | The kind and working strength of the dynamic temporal claim: assumption, conjecture, observed trace, diagnostic reading, planning model, control model, calibrated model, causal claim, benchmark claim, assurance claim, or promise-like claim. This is not a maturity ladder: a causal claim is not a stronger diagnostic reading, and a promise-like claim is not a stronger benchmark. Changing posture may change the governing relation, pattern, evidence basis, or assurance pattern. | Reading a dynamic temporal claim as stronger or differently typed than this posture is a relation change; use the FPF pattern that governs that stronger claim. |
| dynOrder | Pattern-local classification: `Dyn0`, `Dyn1`, or `Dyn2`. | Classification of a claim, not a Kernel kind. |
| baseCharacteristicRef | The characteristic whose state/rate/rate-change is being discussed. | Mandatory only when measurement, comparison, or C.16 relation is load-bearing; otherwise the `target` line may carry a local Plain phrase. |
| stateMeasureRef | Measurement reference for a state/snapshot reading. | C.16-compatible when used as evidence or comparison. |
| rateMeasureRef | Measurement reference for rate, tempo, throughput, cadence, flow, trend, or trajectory. | C.16-compatible and separate from state measure when load-bearing. |
| rateChangeReadingMeasureRef | Measurement reference used as evidence for an acceleration, deceleration, braking, redirection, stabilization, hazard-change, queue-pressure-change, or other rate-change reading. | C.16-compatible; this is evidence for a reading, not a new primitive acceleration measure. |
| publishedOrTargetedMeasureRef | The measure being used as reading, dashboard signal, target, gate, incentive, budget input, or public comparison. | C.16 carries measurement legality and comparability; target/proxy use belongs outside C.27 when load-bearing. |
| targetOrIncentiveUse | How the metric is used as a target, incentive, optimization proxy, management signal, or behavior-shaping prompt. | E.13, assurance, or governance patterns carry proxy/utility distortion. |
| dashboardGatePromiseOrBudgetUse | Whether the metric appears in a dashboard, gate, promise, budget, review, or public comparison. | Names boundary/assurance pattern relations when those uses are live. |
| behaviorChangeRisk | How publication, target pressure, incentive, or gate use may change behavior. | C.27 records temporal intervention risk; causal/evaluation claim still needs causal/evaluation relation. |
| temporalWorkChangeVsMeasurementChangeNote | Split between real work/process rate change, measurement/probe effect, gaming/selection effect, and causal effect if claimed. | Prevents metric improvement from being read as system improvement. |
| C16RouteRef | Route/reference for lawful measurement construction, comparability, and evidence. | C.27 cites it; C.27 does not define metric legality. |
| E13ProxyAuditRef | Route/reference for proxy-metric distortion, pragmatic utility, or value/proxy divergence. | Keeps metric-as-target work out of C.27 when the dynamic temporal claim is not live. |
| C26RouteRef | Route/reference for residual probe/frame/order/export/coarsening cue. | Only present after ordinary C.27/C.16/E.13 pattern relations leave a residual quantum-like cue. |
| residualQLCue | The cue that a remaining probe, frame, order, export, coarsening, or similar representational condition may change the lawful reading after ordinary FPF patterns have carried their parts. | Plain cue; vocabulary alone does not make QL relevant. |
| residualQLRouteRef | The specific residual QL cue, if any, that still matters to supported use after ordinary temporal, measurement, work, benchmark, value/proxy, scale, adaptation, viability, promise, or evidence pattern relations are named. | C.26 carries the QL discipline; C.27 only records the pattern-reference need. |
| ordinaryRouteBasisRef | Reference or short basis showing which ordinary FPF pattern relation already carries the non-QL relation. | Prevents QL from stealing measurement, work, value, benchmark, scale, adaptation, viability, or promise work. |
| DHCMethodRef | Reference to the declared method for constructing or interpreting the characteristic/measure. | Existing C.16 relation; not a new measurement primitive. |
| scaleVariableRef | The resource or scale variable whose change is claimed to change rate, improvement, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization: review capacity, tool-call budget, token budget, sprint count, data volume, model capacity, parallelism, freedom of action, or domain-local scale variable. | Resolves through C.18.1 or the FPF object that carries the resource/scale variable; not a new force or effort kind. |
| scaleWindowRef | The scale range or window over which the scale-variable claim is asserted. | C.18.1 carries scale-window discipline; G.9 carries parity when compared. |
| scaleElasticityPosture | Qualitative C.18.1 posture for the scale claim: rising, knee, flat, declining, or unknown. | Not a numeric scaling law and not proof that more scale is better. |
| C18_1RouteRef | Route/reference for C.18.1 scaling-law lens adequacy when a scale-variable or elasticity claim is live. | C.27 cites it; C.27 does not define scaling-law discipline. |
| TaskFamilyRef | The declared task family whose time-to-usable-specialization or adaptation speed is being discussed. | C.22.1 carries the task-family adaptation signature; C.27 only states the temporal-claim question. |
| TaskSignature | The declared task signature or specialization signature used by C.22.1. | Not a C.27 kind; used only to prevent generic learning-speed talk. |
| thresholdOrUsableSpecializationRef | The threshold, criterion, or usable-specialization target that makes "adapted faster" inspectable. | Keeps adaptation-speed claims from becoming vague improvement claims. |
| timeToThresholdRef | The time window or time-to-threshold reference for reaching the declared adaptation target. | C.27 may type the temporal-claim question; C.22.1 carries adaptation-signature meaning. |
| budgetToThresholdRef | The effort, resource, exposure, or budget reference needed to reach the declared adaptation target. | Routes budget/exposure detail through C.22.1 and work/resource patterns when load-bearing. |
| C22_1RouteRef | Route/reference for C.22.1 task-family adaptation signature reference. | Mandatory when `dyn2TaskFamilyAdaptationRoute?` is active. |
| viabilityBearerRef | The system, collective system, delivery system, role configuration, organism-as-system, service situation, or declared bearer whose viability is being discussed. | C.26.3 carries viability-envelope discipline; C.27 only names the temporal move when live. |
| protectedPromiseOrFunctionRef | The promise, function, or operating regime that the viability envelope is meant to preserve. | Routes to C.26.3 and promise/boundary/service patterns when load-bearing. |
| C26_3RouteRef | Route/reference for C.26.3 viability-envelope boundary regulation when temporal change is used to preserve viable bounds. | Mandatory when `dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRoute?` is active; C.27 does not define viability envelopes. |
| timeBase | Time basis of an underlying dynamics model, if a model is live. | Do not use it as a catch-all for every claim/sampling/effort/rhythm window. |
| claimWindowRef | The time window over which the Dyn2 claim is asserted. | Separate from evidence and effort windows when needed. |
| samplingWindowRef | The time window over which state/rate/rate-change evidence is sampled. | Required for noisy derivative-like readings used in stronger claims. |
| effortWindowRef | The time window over which planned or actual effort/input is applied. | Routes to planning/work patterns. |
| rhythmWindowRef | The window over which rhythm/cadence/phase relation is asserted. | Routes to rhythm-bearing note discipline; not `U.Rhythm`. |
| temporalScalePosture | Optional declaration of the time scale that carries the authored temporal claim used beyond the local working context: spot, episode, sprint, lifecycle, learning-cycle, technoevolution, lifetime, or domain-local. | Use only when scale changes the claim's supported use, bearer, evidence, or reopen condition; it is not a new temporal kind. |
| validityWindowRef | The period or condition over which the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` remains valid. | Carries the refresh/reopen basis. |
| rateChangeIntent | The intended temporal move: accelerate, decelerate, brake, redirect, coast, pause, stabilize, widen, narrow, recover, sustain, or domain-local move. | Avoids acceleration-only bias. |
| interventionRegime | The intervention pattern: impulse, scheduled, feedback, adaptive, exploratory, or policy rule. | Routes to planning/control/policy patterns when formal. |
| controlHorizon | The horizon over which a control-style intervention is evaluated or adjusted. | Only live for `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` claims. |
| closedLoopUpdate | The feedback/update rule by which later observations change the intervention. | Routes to control/model patterns when reusable or formal. |
| behaviorPolicyRef | The source policy, regime, or practice that produced the evidence being reused. | Only live when policy/regime evidence is used as the basis for another policy or adaptive claim. |
| proposedPolicyRef | The proposed or evaluation policy, regime, rollout, or intervention rule being argued for. | Separate from `behaviorPolicyRef`; otherwise off-policy transfer is hidden. |
| offPolicyRisk | Risk that evidence from one policy/regime does not carry another policy/regime use. | Routes to sequential decision/evaluation discipline. |
| stopRule | Condition for stopping, braking, pausing, replanning, or exiting the intervention. | Carries affordability and harm-control basis. |
| controlPolicyRouteRef | The FPF pattern relation used when the claim needs formal dynamics, search/policy health, agentic action, or evaluation basis: `U.Dynamics`, C.19, C.24, or an evaluation pattern. | C.27 records the crossing; the referenced pattern carries the stronger control/policy discipline. |
| plannedEffortRef | Reference to planned effort in WorkPlan, MethodDescription, resource envelope, or planning pattern. | Ex ante plan, not actual burn. |
| actualEffortTraceRef | Reference to observed work/resource/time burn or trace. | Cites `U.Work` / `Gamma_work`, not `U.Dynamics`. |
| inputCharacteristicRefs | Characteristics treated as inputs to a dynamics or intervention claim. | Existing characteristic/model discipline. |
| effortProfile | Mapping from time window to effort/input posture. | Pattern-local description of effort timing; not a new law. |
| interventionActorRef | The actor, role assignment, tool, system, policy rule, or work arrangement claimed to apply the intervention. | Resolves through A.15, planning, role, method, work, or agentic-action patterns; not a new physical-mechanism kind. |
| interventionAuthorityPosture | Whether the intervention actor/role is authorized, proposed, hypothetical, unknown, assigned, available, or otherwise scoped. | Missing authority/capability bounds supported use rather than creating proof of executable work. |
| capabilityOrScopeRef | Reference to the scope, capability, assignment, or availability basis for the intervention actor/role. | Routes role/method/work alignment to A.15 and work patterns; C.27 only makes the supported-use limit visible. |
| resistanceOrInertiaProxy | Domain-local reason that changing the rate is hard, delayed, sticky, or costly. | Proxy with `resistanceProxyBasisPosture` and evidence; not literal mass. |
| resistanceProxyFamily | Pattern-local grouping of resistance/inertia proxy: lag, queue, habit, constraint, coordination cost, technical debt, operational-support load, physical inertia, or domain-local family. | Not a `U.Kind`; Plain/Tech mapping must stay explicit. |
| resistanceProxyBasisPosture | Whether a resistance/inertia proxy is qualitative, measured, modelled, assumed, unknown, or otherwise declared. | Prevents weak assumptions becoming strong evidence. |
| evidenceRef | Evidence reference that supplies the basis for a field. | Routes to evidence patterns. |
| interventionConstraintRefs | Resource, safety, service, legal, ethical, quality, or domain constraints that bound the intervention. | These constraints are not governed by C.27; C.27 records that they are active. |
| resourceEnvelopeRef | Resource boundary for the intervention. | Planning/resource pattern. |
| safetyEnvelopeRef | Safety boundary for the intervention. | Assurance/safety pattern. |
| serviceEnvelopeRef | Service boundary or operational envelope. | Service/promise/boundary pattern. |
| legalOrEthicalEnvelopeRef | Legal, ethical, or compliance boundary. | Legal/ethics/assurance pattern. |
| qualityEnvelopeRef | Quality boundary affected by acceleration, braking, or rate-change. | Quality pattern such as C.25 where applicable. |
| uncertaintyPosture | Declared uncertainty around model, measurement, evidence basis, stability, or transfer. | May force downgrade or stronger evidence relation. |
| dyn2CausalUsePosture | Declared causal-use posture and its details for a Dyn2 temporal claim. | C.27 does not supply causal/evaluation claim by itself; use `dyn2CausalUseRoute?` only when causal use is live. |
| interventionRef | The intervention, effort, workshop, policy, regime, practice change, or other action being treated as causal. | C.27 may name it; causal/evaluation patterns carry the estimand, assumptions, identification/evaluation design, and supported causal-use judgement. |
| comparatorOrCounterfactualRef | Comparator, contrast case, counterfactual, control group, prior regime, or declared absence of one. | Required when causal reading is live; otherwise the claim remains planning/diagnostic. |
| timeZeroOrAssignmentWindow | The start, assignment, exposure, or intervention window for the causal reading. | Keeps before/after slope stories from hiding timing ambiguity. |
| followUpWindowRef | The outcome observation window after intervention/exposure. | Separate from claim, sampling, effort, rhythm, and validity windows when they differ. |
| outcomeMeasureRef | The measured outcome whose change is being causally read. | Routes to C.16/evidence discipline when load-bearing. |
| estimand | The causal/evaluation quantity being estimated when causal-use basis is claimed. | Causal/evaluation pattern. |
| assumptions | Assumptions under which the causal/model/evaluation claim holds. | Not hidden inside C.27 shorthand. |
| rivalCauses | Alternative causes that could explain observed rate-change. | Required when causal reading is live. |
| identificationOrEvaluationDesignRef | Identification strategy, experiment, quasi-experiment, evaluation design, or evidence-design reference. | Routes to causal/evaluation discipline; absent design limits supported causal use. |
| supportedCausalUse | The causal conclusion or decision use carried by the causal/evaluation relation. | Must be no stronger than design, assumptions, outcome evidence, and uncertainty. |
| unsupportedCausalUse | Causal conclusion, action, or assurance claim not carried by the causal/evaluation relation. | Prevents C.27 temporal adequacy from laundering into causal/evaluation claim. |
| comparedClaimRefs | Claims, methods, variants, practices, agents, or regimes being compared by dynamic outcome. | `G.9` carries parity; C.27 names the dynamic claim question of the comparison. |
| dynOrderCompared | Whether the comparison is Dyn1 rate/trend comparison or Dyn2 intervention-sensitive rate-change comparison. | Prevents rate comparison from being laundered into intervention superiority. |
| baselineWindowRef | Baseline or starting window used by the comparison. | Must not be mixed silently across compared claims. |
| adaptationOrInterventionWindowRef | Window in which adaptation, effort, intervention, rollout, training, or practice change occurs. | Optional; required when Dyn2 comparison depends on intervention timing. |
| budgetOrEffortParityRef | Budget, effort, resource, or work-parity reference needed for fair dynamic comparison. | Routes to `G.9`, work, and resource patterns when load-bearing. |
| rateOrRateChangeReadingMeasureRef | Measurement reference used as evidence for compared rate, recovery, rhythm, throughput, or rate-change reading. | Routes to C.16 measurement discipline. |
| G9ParityPlanRef | `G.9` parity plan reference for baseline, freshness, comparator, bridge, and evidence pins. | Mandatory when benchmark parity is load-bearing. |
| G9ParityReportRef | Optional `G.9` parity report reference carrying outcomes/evidence. | Needed for published or benchmark used beyond the local working context result. |
| evidenceBranches | Decomposition of evidence by state, rate, rate-change, effort, resistance, rhythm, or causal effect. | Shows which branches are evidence and which remain assumptions. |
| stateEvidenceRefs | Evidence for state/snapshot reading. | Evidence/C.16 relation. |
| rateEvidenceRefs | Evidence for rate/trend/trajectory reading. | Evidence/C.16 relation. |
| rateChangeEvidenceRefs | Evidence for rate-change/intervention-sensitive reading. | Evidence/C.16 relation. |
| effortEvidenceRefs | Evidence for planned or actual effort. | Planning/work relation. |
| resistanceEvidenceRefs | Evidence for resistance/inertia proxy. | Domain evidence relation. |
| rhythmEvidenceRefs | Evidence for rhythm/cadence/coupling. | Rhythm proxy/evidence relation. |
| causalEvidenceRefs | Evidence for causal attribution. | Causal/evaluation relation. |
| dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock | Declared relation when a Dyn2 temporal claim moves across levels, bearers, or aggregation. | Unsupported unless aggregation basis, bearer continuity, and mix-shift risk are addressed. |
| sourceBearerRef | Bearer where evidence or claim originates. | Existing object reference. |
| targetBearerRef | Target bearer for boundary-crossing use. | Existing object reference. |
| aggregationRoute | Rule or evidence path by which local/aggregate readings are related. | Routes to aggregation/model/evidence pattern. |
| mixShiftRisk | Risk that composition changes explain the apparent rate-change. | Must be named before cross-scale transfer. |
| dynamicTransferPosture | Whether cross-scale transfer is carried by declared bearer continuity and aggregation basis, remains unsupported, or is unknown. | Prevents aggregate acceleration laundering. |
| accelerationDebt | Consequence or residue created by sustained acceleration, braking, recovery, stabilization, or redirection: rework, operational-support load, quality loss, burnout, risk, hidden queue, or coordination cost. | Use only when supported use relies on sustained acceleration/braking/recovery/stabilization or when the domain can retain residue after effort changes or stops. |
| debtKind | Kind of debt or residue. | Domain-local, with evidence if load-bearing. |
| debtWindowRef | Window over which debt appears or must be repaid. | Separate from effort and claim windows when needed. |
| reversibilityPosture | Whether the dynamic change is reversible, costly to reverse, irreversible within window, or unknown. | `unknown` is allowed; it bounds supported use instead of forcing theory-building. |
| reversibilityNote | Short explanation of why reversibility has that posture. | Captures hysteresis and residue only when load-bearing. |
| hysteresisOrResidue | What remains after effort changes or stops. | Domain-local description requiring evidence when load-bearing. |
| repaymentOrBrakePlan | Plan to repay debt, brake, recover, or stabilize. | Planning/assurance pattern if load-bearing. |
| debtHysteresisRouteRef | Route/reference for planning, assurance, quality, wellbeing, or safety relation when debt/hysteresis is load-bearing. | C.27 records the temporal-claim question; referenced patterns carry the stronger discipline. |

| brakeOrRecoveryPlan | Plan for braking, recovery, stabilization, or rollback. | Planning/assurance pattern when load-bearing. |
| supportedUse | The uses this C.27 temporal-claim record can carry. | Must match `dynClaimPosture` and evidence. |
| unsupportedUse | Nearby uses this note/profile does not support. | Prevents hidden escalation. |
| reopenTrigger | Condition that requires refresh, downgrade, stronger evidence, or reference to another pattern. | Evolvability trigger for the claim. |

C.27 has a small core. Specialized cases are C.27 dynamic-claim relations
or optional profile blocks for authored temporal claims used beyond the local working context; they are not mandatory rules
for every C.27 use.

These entries are not a general relation list. They apply only after an
authored temporal claim already has C.27 relevance because it changes supported use.
Each entry names the neighbouring FPF pattern to inspect when that C.27-typed
dynamic claim also depends on one non-C.27 question. If the text has no state,
rate, rate-change, rhythm, regime, recovery, stabilization, transfer, or
intervention relation that changes supported use, no entry here applies.

| Dynamic-claim relation | C.27 relation and next FPF pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Formal dynamics | Reusable law, simulation, prediction, control, or calibrated dynamics is carried by `A.3.3 U.Dynamics`, `C.16`, work evidence, `G.9`, and assurance patterns. |
| C.16 rate measurement relation | Rate and rate-change readings used as evidence, benchmark, gate, control, or C.27 profile use include `c16RateMeasurementRouteRef?`; C.27 cites `C16RouteRef` and does not define measurement legality. |
| C.27 effort/work block | `dyn2EffortWorkBlock?` separates planned effort, method description, resource envelope, actual `U.Work` / `Gamma_work` trace, effort window, intervention actor/role assignment, and authority/capability posture; A.15 and work patterns carry role/method/work alignment. |
| C.27 resistance/inertia block | `dyn2ResistanceInertiaBlock?` names resistance proxy family, resistance proxy basis posture, evidence, and unsupported stronger use; `resistanceProxyBasisPosture = unknown` may carry local diagnostic use but blocks durable acceleration, causal, benchmark, promise-like, or assurance use. |
| C.27 rhythm claim block | `dyn2RhythmClaimBlock?` names bearer, anchor, window, proxy/evidence, and supported use; coupling, phase, synchronization, or entrainment-like details appear only when the supported use depends on a relation between bearers. |
| C.27 causal-use relation | `dyn2CausalUseRoute?` is present only when a rate-change/intervention story is used as a causal-use basis; it requires contrast/counterfactual, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, supported causal use, unsupported causal use, and causal/evaluation relation. |
| C.27 dynamic benchmark requirement | `dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock?` declares the rate/rate-change/rhythm/recovery/intervention-effect requirement of a comparison; it is a benchmark input declaration, not a benchmark harness. `G.9` carries baseline, freshness, comparator, bridge, parity plan, and parity report discipline. |
| C.27 metric-as-target block | `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` splits metric-as-measure, metric-as-target/incentive, metric publication as temporal intervention, and residual probe/frame/export cue; C.16 carries measurement, E.13/assurance carries proxy distortion, and C.26 applies only after ordinary FPF pattern relations leave residual QL cue. |
| C.27 cross-scale transfer field | `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` keeps local and aggregate dynamic readings separate; cross-scale use needs source/target bearer, aggregation basis, bearer continuity, mix-shift risk, and explicit `dynamicTransferPosture`. |
| Object-centric dynamic trace | Workflow/process rate claims need bearer, object/event trace, interaction, and convergence/divergence discipline rather than one generic process-speed label. |
| Method composition or emergent workflow | If the live claim is about how method parts compose, how an adaptive workflow becomes a capability, or how repeated practice changes shape, C.27 handles only the temporal adequacy of the rate, rhythm, recovery, stabilization, or rate-change claim. `B.1.5` carries order-sensitive method composition and work enactment; `B.2.4` carries meta-functional transition and capability-emergence questions. |
| Lifecycle/evolution or language-state movement | If the live claim is that a system, episteme, method, cue, branch, or language-state relation evolved, reopened, stabilized, operationalized, retired, or moved through a lifecycle, C.27 handles only the temporal adequacy of any speed/rhythm/recovery/stabilization claim. `A.4` / `B.4` carry temporal duality and canonical evolution loops; `A.16` / `B.4.1` carry language-state move and cue-stabilization discipline. |
| C.27 scale-variable claim block | `dyn2ScaleVariableClaimBlock?` is present only when changing review capacity, tool calls, tokens, sprints, data, model capacity, parallelism, freedom of action, or another declared scale variable is used as the basis for a rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization claim; C.18.1 carries scale variables, scale windows, scale probes, and elasticity posture. |
| Autonomy-budget or freedom-of-action claim | If freedom of action, action tokens, decision tokens, guard cadence, depletion, pause/resume, or autonomy-gated work is used as the basis for a rate-change or stabilization claim, C.27 states the temporal claim only. `E.16` carries autonomy budgets, guard checks, ledger evidence, depletion behavior, and override speech acts. |
| C.27 viability-envelope relation | `dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRoute?` is present only when braking, throttling, rollout speed, cadence change, recovery timing, adaptation cost, or stabilization is used to keep a declared viability bearer inside usable bounds; C.26.3 carries viability-envelope boundary regulation. |
| Authored-unit drift around temporal wording | When a paragraph, note, working section, comparison, explanation, or decision-facing text mixes method-description, repeated-practice, service-boundary, rhythm, capability-claim, improvement, benchmark, and promise wording so that the primary object of talk or active claim question is unstable, use E.17.AUD, E.17.ID.CR, or the relevant authored-unit pattern first. C.27 is active only when a temporal-claim adequacy question remains after that stabilization. |
| C.27 control/policy relation | `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` is present only for `controlModel`, `policyRule`, `adaptive`, feedback-bearing `planningModel`, or explicit C.24/C.19/evaluation relations; C.27 records the crossing and names the pattern that carries formal control/MPC/RL/policy evaluation. |
| Dynamic policy transfer | Pattern-reference-only inside `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?`: sequential decision/evaluation discipline carries behavior-policy/evaluation-policy and off-policy transfer claims rather than default C.27 fields. |
| Explore/exploit | C.19 carries policy health for search, convergence, narrowing, widening, and switching-rate claims. |
| Creative or open-ended search speed | Claims about faster novelty, illumination, archive growth, frontier coverage, candidate generation, or candidate-set improvement use C.17 for novelty/value measures, C.18 for open-ended search calculus, and C.19 for pool policy; C.27 only names the temporal adequacy question when speed/change affects supported use. |
| Task-family adaptation speed | If the claim concerns acquiring usable specialization on one declared `TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`, C.27 types the learning/adaptation-rate question and C.22.1 carries threshold target, time-to-threshold, budget-to-threshold, prior exposure, transfer, retention, downside, and corridor-entry evidence. |
| C.27 debt/hysteresis block | `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` is present only when supported use depends on sustained acceleration, braking, recovery, stabilization, residue after effort changes, or high-stakes/promise/gate use; `unknown` reversibility is allowed but bounds supported use. |
| Promise / boundary / service acceptance | `A.2.3`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, `A.6.C`, `F.12`, and assurance patterns carry service promises, SLA-like statements, agreement-language expectations, release gates, public commitments, boundary obligations, and service-acceptance bindings. |
| Evidence/provenance path | If a C.27 card/profile cites traces, assumptions, work evidence, evidence carriers, `PathId`, `PathSlice`, validity window, or evidence decay, C.27 states the temporal reading that needs an evidence basis. `A.10` / `G.6` carry evidence graph referring, provenance anchors, citable path/slice discipline, and SCR/RSCR-visible evidence bindings; `B.3` / `B.3.4` carry assurance posture and evidence decay / epistemic debt. |
| Dashboard telemetry, pack shipping, or refresh use | If a dashboard, time-series, telemetry pin, RSCR trigger, shipped pack, discipline-health slot, or dashboard slice is used as evidence for improvement, decay, recovery, stabilization, or rate-change, C.27 names the temporal-claim adequacy question. `C.21` carries discipline-health slot meaning; `G.12` carries DHC series/row/slice and telemetry-pin publication; `G.10` carries pack shipping; `G.11` carries refresh/decay orchestration; `G.6` carries path/slice evidence visibility. |
| Transduction gate or flow use | If a C.27-typed temporal claim is used as a `GateCheckRef` input, `GateDecisionRationale`, `LaunchGate` condition, `PathSlice` refresh trigger, crossing condition, or published flow condition, C.27 states only the temporal-claim adequacy question. `E.18` / `A.20` / `A.21` carry the transduction graph, `OperationalGate(profile)`, `ConstraintValidity`, `GateFit`, `DecisionLog`, `PathSlice`, `SquareLaw`, `Gamma_time`, and crossing pins. |
| Derivative noise | Noisy rate-change readings used for comparison, benchmark, gate, or control need sampling-window and stability posture, or downgrade. |
| Coasting | Coasting needs a basis when continued movement or stability after effort changes or stops carries the claim. |
| High-stakes temporal move | Pattern-reference-only relation: high-stakes acceleration, braking, or redirection claims name the temporal move/window/unsupported use and cite the harm/resource/quality envelope or the assurance, ethics, legal, safety, financial, or human-wellbeing pattern that carries the stronger question. |
| C.26 residual relation | C.27 does not add QL relation. If a Dyn2 claim also depends on probe/frame/order/export/coarsening residue that ordinary FPF patterns cannot carry, C.26 carries the residue after ordinary C.27/C.24/C.16/G.9/E.13 pattern relations are named. |
| No new publication object | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` and `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` are pattern-local records/cards, not new Part G publication roles, MVPK faces, governed objects of related FPF patterns, or Kernel types. |
| Use-triggered lint | Useful lint requires temporal-improvement wording plus decision, comparison, budget, benchmark, gate, promise, publication, assurance, or intervention-plan use. |

Plain words may remain didactic. Tech prose must name the FPF pattern that carries the load-bearing question.
Problem frames, Forces, and worked examples may use speed, force, inertia,
acceleration, rhythm, cadence, agility, or process-speed language when it helps
recognition. Field definitions, conformance requirements, and governing-pattern
relations should use the Tech readings below.
Minted C.27-local labels must carry the dynamic claim question in the label: use
`Dyn2`, `Temporal`, `RateChange`, `Rhythm`, `Inertia`,
`CrossScale`, `MetricTarget`, `ControlPolicy`, or another explicit dynamic
qualifier. A generic head such as `Profile`, `Card`, `Process`, `Service`,
`Practice`, `Policy`, `Harm`, `OperationalSupport`, or `Envelope` is not enough by itself.
Ordinary prose may use those words only as Plain examples or after resolving the
actual FPF object or governing pattern.

| Plain wording | FPF-safe Tech reading |
| --- | --- |
| speed | rate, throughput, tempo, or trajectory reading with C.16 basis when load-bearing |
| acceleration | rate-change, regime transition, policy effect, or finite-difference reading |
| effort / force | planned effort, input characteristic, intervention actor/role assignment, actual work/resource trace, or resource envelope |
| mass / inertia | domain-local resistance or inertia proxy: lag, switching cost, coordination cost, queue pressure, habit strength, physical inertia, or constraint |
| rhythm / cadence | interval-structured bearer/anchor/window/evidence relation; coupling only for cross-bearer claims |
| agility | braking, redirection, acceleration, stabilization, recovery, and constraint handling |
| process sped up | first resolve the bearer as system, work, method description, service promise/boundary, or event-log view; then add the C.27 temporal-claim question only if rate-change use is live |
| more calls / more context | agentic action whose target rate must be named, not automatic acceleration |

Avoid as Tech tokens unless already governed by the named pattern:
`carrierOrSubject`, `D2DynamicsProfile`, `Metric`, `Axis`, `Dimension`,
`Process`, `Practice`, `Service`, generic card names, `Profile`, `ProcessBearer`,
`PolicyEvaluation`, `HarmEnvelope`, `force`, `mass`, `acceleration`, and
`rhythm`.

Prefer: `DynOrder`, `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`,
`describedEntityRef`, `temporalBearerRef`, `profileCarrierRef`,
`baseCharacteristicRef`, `MeasureRef`, `DHCMethodRef`, `claimWindowRef`,
`samplingWindowRef`, `effortWindowRef`, `rhythmWindowRef`,
`plannedEffortRef`, `actualEffortTraceRef`, `inputCharacteristicRefs`,
`interventionActorRef`, `interventionAuthorityPosture`, `capabilityOrScopeRef`,
`resistanceOrInertiaProxy`, `resistanceProxyBasisPosture`,
`dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?`, `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?`,
`dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?`, `dyn2HighStakesTemporalMoveRoute?`,
`supportedUse`, `unsupportedUse`, and `reopenTrigger`.

The dynamic-order labels are values of a claim classification, not kinds of
things. Dyn0, Dyn1, and Dyn2 classify what a temporal claim treats as sufficient
for its use. They do not become `U.Dyn0`, `U.Dyn1`, `U.Dyn2`,
`U.Acceleration`, `U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, `U.Force`, or
`U.SecondOrderProcess`.

Kind-locality rule: `DynOrder`, `Dyn0`, `Dyn1`, `Dyn2`,
`Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, and `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` name readings
or records of authored temporal claims. They do not classify the governed object
itself unless an existing FPF pattern separately types that object. "Team
throughput accelerated" may receive a Dyn2 claim reading; the team does not
become a `Dyn2System`, throughput does not become `U.Acceleration`, and the
card/profile does not become a dynamics law.

`Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` is a pattern-local episteme record about the adequacy of
a temporal claim. It is not `U.Dynamics`, `U.Work`, `U.WorkPlan`,
`U.MethodDescription`, `U.Measure`, or `CharacteristicSpace`. If materialized
as a document, card, table, or file, that material is a carrier of the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`
content, not the actual work, process, law, practice, or system being discussed.

A.7 object/description/carrier split: `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` and
`Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` are authored descriptions of temporal-claim adequacy.
They are not the dynamic system, not the work trace, not the measure, not the
service promise, not the intervention actor/role, not the dynamics law, and not identical to the
document/card/page that carries them.

The object split is:

| Object | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `describedEntityRef` | the entity/work/method/system/practice-like object the claim discusses, resolved through existing FPF kinds where load-bearing |
| `temporalBearerRef` | the object whose state, rate, rhythm, or regime is being read |
| `profileCarrierRef` | optional card/file/page carrier of the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` content, only when publication/evidence needs it |
| `plannedEffortRef` | plan/method/resource-envelope basis for intended effort |
| `actualEffortTraceRef` | `U.Work` or `Gamma_work` basis for actual burn |
| `dynamicsModelRef` | `U.Dynamics` basis when a law/model of change is claimed |

Loose words require resolution in Tech prose. A process may be a method recipe,
dated work run, transition law, event-log view, or service situation. A practice
may be method description plus work traces. A service claim may involve system,
promise content, delivery work, boundary semantics, or assurance. C.27 should
not use these as untyped substitutes for FPF objects.

**AI-assisted drafting posture (informative).** An AI-assisted draft may propose
that C.27 is relevant, but a profile appears only after the supported use and the
boundary-crossing reason are named. First classify the prose as ordinary prose,
Dyn0, Dyn1, Dyn2 card, or profile/pattern relation. The draft does not infer:
more tool calls means better reasoning; faster narrowing means better search;
higher throughput means better quality; metric improvement means system
improvement; or trend means intervention model.

### C.27:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Read these cases before the fuller field definitions. They show lawful stopping points for ordinary work:

- no C.27 record for ordinary state, metaphor, or unsupported broad-use language;
- Dyn1 or C.16 when the live issue is only measured rate;
- `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` when a local temporal intervention, rhythm, braking, coasting, or tool-use rate-change claim needs bounded basis;
- `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` or a named FPF pattern relation only when the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context, benchmarks, promises, assures, becomes causal, crosses scale, or carries a stronger decision-use.

**Example breadth (informative).** C.27 appears across several work domains, not
only project-velocity prose.


| Domain | Example | Why C.27 cares |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Software operations | Incident recovery became faster after a playbook. | Promise, viability, and service-boundary risk can hide inside a recovery-speed claim. |
| Team workflow | Backlog reduction under added reviewers. | Effort, window, resistance, and hidden work must be named. |
| AI agent | More tool calls speed debugging. | Tool-call count is effort/input evidence, not reasoning-quality evidence. |
| Benchmark | Method A improves faster than Method B. | Dynamic comparison needs G.9 parity, not only C.27 prose. |
| Metric target | Velocity target improves velocity. | Metric-as-measure, target pressure, work change, proxy distortion, and residual probe cue stay distinct. |
| Search | Faster shortlist. | Faster narrowing can damage exploration health and frontier coverage. |
| Learning | Time-to-threshold on one task family. | C.22.1 carries task-family adaptation signature. |
| Rhythm/practice | Daily drills stabilize review rhythm. | Rhythm needs bearer, anchor, window, basis/proxy, and supported use. |
| Scale | More tokens, data, or reviewers improve rate. | C.18.1 carries scale variable and elasticity posture. |
| Cross-scale | Team throughput becomes organization agility. | Aggregation basis, bearer continuity, and mix shift must be visible. |
| Viability | Slow rollout protects support capacity. | Braking can be the adequate temporal move; slowing down is a supported envelope-regulation outcome when acceleration would damage recovery, support load, or promise reliability. |
| QL negative | Dashboard or probe wording appears. | C.26 is relevant only for residual probe/frame/export/coarsening cue after ordinary pattern relations. |


| Teaching case | Example | Expected classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Snapshot | "Backlog is 120 items today." | Dyn0; no C.27 record unless use changes. |
| Trend | "Backlog fell by 20 items/week." | Dyn1 with C.16 measurement basis if load-bearing. |
| Intervention | "Adding review capacity for two sprints will double backlog reduction rate." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` usually overkill unless the authored temporal claim is used beyond local pilot or plan use. |
| Benchmark / publication | "Method A improves faster than Method B and should be published as superior." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` or pattern reference is justified: G.9 benchmark parity, C.16 measurement, possible causal/evaluation relation, and C.27 dynamic-claim relation declaration. |
| Dynamic anti-leaderboard | "Both methods reached the same final score, so they are equivalent." | Not enough if adaptation window, effort parity, hidden rework, validity window, or recovery profile differs; G.9 carries parity and C.27 names the temporal parity question. |
| Agentic tool-use | "More tool calls will speed debugging." | C.24 plus `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; tool-call count is effort/input evidence, not task-success, evidence-quality, repair-success, or cost evidence, so the claim names task outcome, evaluation harness, stop/replan condition, validity window, and unsupported stronger benchmark use. |
| Scale trap | "Doubling reviewers, data, or model capacity will double improvement rate." | C.18.1 carries scale variable, scale window, probes, and elasticity posture; C.27 is live only if the scale claim is used as a rate-change basis, and linear temporal improvement remains unsupported without evidence. |


| Rhythm / practice | "Daily drills stabilize training rhythm." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` with rhythm bearer, anchor, window, basis/proxy, and supported use; coupling only if the claim depends on synchronization between bearers. |
| False positive | "This chapter accelerates reader orientation." | Usually ordinary prose; no C.27 record unless used as a claim about method effectiveness. |
| Causal trap | "Velocity rose after the workshop, so the workshop caused it." | C.27 marks the temporal-claim question only; causal/evidence relation is required before causal use. |
| Cross-scale trap | "Team throughput accelerated, so every service improved." | `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` is unsupported without source/target bearer, aggregation basis, bearer continuity, mix-shift risk, and `dynamicTransferPosture`. |
| Braking | "Slow rollout protects support capacity." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` depending on supported decision; the move may be a correct protection of viability, not a failure to accelerate. |


Additional dynamic near-misses:

| Case | Example | Expected classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coasting | "Adoption continues after incentives stop." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` with coasting basis and reopen trigger. |
| High-stakes temporal move | "We can cut review time in half for this regulated release." | Pattern-reference-only `dyn2HighStakesTemporalMoveRoute?` plus assurance/legal/quality relation, or claim downgraded. |
| Premature convergence | "The search process is better because we reached a shortlist faster." | C.19 relation; distinguish faster narrowing from healthy search. |
| Metric target | "Velocity improved after becoming the quarterly target." | `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` only if target publication changes temporal behavior/supported-use; C.16 carries measurement, E.13/proxy audit carries utility distortion, and C.26 applies only for residual probe/frame/export cue. |
| Scale-variable fantasy | "More data, model capacity, reviewers, tokens, or parallelism will improve twice as fast." | C.18.1 carries scale variables, scale windows, scale probes, and elasticity posture; C.27 only names the temporal claim when the scale variable is used as the basis for rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization. |
| Off-policy transfer | "The old rollout policy improved recovery, so the new rollout policy will too." | `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` must name `behaviorPolicyRef`, `proposedPolicyRef`, `offPolicyRisk`, and evaluation/control relation; one observed slope under policy A does not carry policy B. |
| Object-centric process trace | "The process sped up" while orders, invoices, shipments, and support tickets move through different paths. | `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` recovers object types, event trace, interactions, aggregation basis, and unsupported whole-workflow truth; one scalar throughput line is not enough. |
| Harmful acceleration / viability | "Faster rollout improved release velocity while support load and recovery time degraded." | C.27 names acceleration/braking/throttling/recovery timing and unsupported stronger use; C.26.3, C.25, assurance, safety, legal, ethics, or wellbeing patterns carry the envelope or harm claim. |

These slices show what C.27 changes in use. They are action examples, not extra forms to fill.

Operations / backlog acceleration:

```text
Claim:
Adding two triage engineers for two sprints will double backlog reduction rate.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2, because a rate-change is tied to a planned intervention.

Minimum useful note:
- rate being changed: backlog reduction per week;
- effort/input: two triage engineers assigned through a WorkPlan for two sprints;
- effort window: sprint N and N+1;
- resistance proxy: review queue coordination cost and domain ramp-up;
- evidence posture: planning assumption plus prior work trace if available;
- supported use: staffing discussion and local plan choice;
- unsupported use: causal/evaluation claim with estimand and identification relation, long-term capacity model, benchmark superiority;
- reopen trigger: queue mix shift, triage saturation, quality loss, or no
  measured reduction after the first sprint.
```

The value is not that every backlog sentence gets a profile. The value is that a
decision-bearing acceleration claim cannot hide effort, window, resistance, and
unsupported stronger use.

Learning / practice transfer:

```text
Claim:
Daily 20-minute drills stabilize the learner's problem-solving rhythm.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 only if the claim is used to select, compare, publish, or justify the
practice. Otherwise it may remain didactic.

Minimum useful note:
- rhythm bearer: learner practice session;
- rhythm anchor: daily drill window and task cycle;
- rhythm proxy/evidence: task completion cadence, error pattern, recall delay,
  or observed practice trace;
- effort profile: short scheduled effort repeated across days;
- resistance proxy: fatigue, attention drift, task novelty, or habit formation;
- supported use: local practice design;
- unsupported use: general proof that the method improves all learning;
- reopen trigger: retention falls, task family changes, or rhythm proxy stops
  matching actual performance.
```

This carries the source article's replicable-practice idea: the useful formal
payload is an effort/rhythm/window description that can be copied and checked,
not a forced equation.

Rhythm/practice style vignette:

```text
Claim:
A training note says "this practice rhythm improves retention", or a dance note
says "this style keeps swing content".

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 only when the rhythm/style claim is used to teach, replicate, compare,
judge, benchmark, or promise a practice outcome. Otherwise it may remain
ordinary explanatory prose.

Minimum useful questions:
- rhythm of what bearer: learner, team, body movement, practice session,
  release workflow, or other existing FPF object?
- anchored to what beat, cycle, release train, attention window, task cycle, or
  domain-local interval?
- what effort or rate-change pattern occurs in which intervals?
- what evidence or instrument proxy supplies the basis for that reading?
- what use is carried: teaching orientation, replication, judging, benchmark,
  or promise?
```

This keeps the article's useful dance/practice insight: style distinction may
depend on effort and rate-change patterns over rhythm intervals, not only on
static poses, single trajectories, mood words, or a general rhythm theory.

Rhythm / embodied or team coordination:

```text
Claim:
The team's release rhythm became smoother after moving review earlier in the
cycle.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 when this carries a method-change, staffing-decision, or benchmark use.

Minimum useful note:
- rhythm bearer: team release workflow, not the repository file or dashboard;
- rhythm anchor: release cycle and review window;
- intervention regime: scheduled shift of review earlier in the cycle;
- instrument proxy: event log, review queue cadence, rework trace, or survey
  only if its resistance proxy basis posture is stated;
- resistance proxy: transfer delay, queue pressure, coordination lag;
- supported use: local method adjustment;
- unsupported use: proof of organizational agility or service promise;
- reopen trigger: work mix changes, release train changes, or hidden rework
  appears.
```

The important correction is that rhythm has a bearer and proxy. It is not a
decorative label for good mood or smoothness.

Agentic tool-use / AI workflow:

```text
Claim:
More tool calls will speed debugging.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 only if the extra calls are used as an intervention claim, not merely as a
local tactic.

Minimum useful note:
- rate being changed: bug localization, evidence confirmation, repair
  iteration, uncertainty reduction, or rollout stabilization;
- effort/input: extra tool calls, broader search, or deeper context retrieval;
- intervention actor: agent, tool runner, or human operator capable of making the calls;
- resistance proxy: noisy output, context overload, search branching, cost, or
  stale evidence;
- outcome/evaluation basis: task success, repair success, evidence quality,
  cost, and validity window if the claim is benchmark-facing;
- stop/replan trigger: no new evidence, conflicting evidence, timeout, rising
  cost, expired validity window, or growing false-positive load;
- unsupported use: "more calls means better reasoning", "faster narrowing is
  always better", or "tool-call count proves benchmark superiority."
```

This keeps C.24 useful without turning tool-use quantity into a proxy for
thinking quality.

Benchmark / faster improvement:

```text
Claim:
Method A improves faster than Method B.

C.27 reading:
`G.9` governs benchmark parity; `dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock?` types the dynamic
outcome and records unsupported benchmark use.

Minimum useful note:
- compared claims: Method A and Method B;
- dynamic order: Dyn1 if only rates are compared, Dyn2 if interventions,
  effort budgets, or rate-change are compared;
- comparable windows: baseline, sampling, claim, validity, and adaptation or
  effort windows;
- comparable effort: planned budget and actual effort trace if relevant;
- G.9 parity: `G9ParityPlanRef` for baseline/freshness/comparator/bridge pins,
  and `G9ParityReportRef?` if a published or reused report exists;
- hidden costs: rework, operational-support load, quality loss, burnout, or debt;
- supported use: benchmark interpretation under stated parity;
- unsupported use: causal superiority, universal method superiority, or release
  gate unless a stronger pattern carries that claim.

```

This prevents "faster" from hiding unequal effort, unequal windows, or unequal
measurement templates.

Service / boundary promise:

```text
Claim:
We recover incidents faster after the new playbook.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 if the playbook is claimed to change recovery rate. If the statement is
used outside the local working context, as an SLA-like expectation, or as readiness evidence, C.27 only
types the temporal-claim question.

Minimum useful note:
- rate being changed: detection-to-mitigation or mitigation-to-recovery time;
- effort/input: playbook, staffing, automation, triage method, or escalation
  policy;
- resistance proxy: incident mix, dependency lag, tool latency, coordination
  bottleneck;
- evidence posture: diagnostic, benchmark, causal, assurance, or promise-like;
- supported use: local incident-response improvement claim;
- unsupported use: formal guarantee, audit closure, release gate, or causal
  proof unless the relevant boundary/evidence/assurance pattern carries it.
```

The key point is that C.27 does not become a hidden promise pattern. It prevents
temporal claims from silently strengthening into promises.

Aggregate / cross-scale transfer:

```text
Claim:
Team throughput accelerated, so the organization became more agile.

C.27 reading:
`dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` is live; local team rate-change and organization
agility are different dynamic readings unless aggregation basis and bearer
continuity are declared.

Minimum useful note:
- source bearer: team workflow and its measured throughput;
- target bearer: organization, portfolio, service family, or ecosystem;
- aggregation basis: how local rate-change maps upward;
- bearer continuity: whether the same work, service, value stream, or population
  remains comparable;
- mix-shift risk: easier work, hidden queues, reassigned work, changed scope, or
  invisible rework;
- dynamicTransferPosture: supported, unsupported, or unknown;
- supported use: local team improvement if evidence supports it;
- unsupported use: organization-level agility claim unless aggregation and
  quality-bundle relations are present.

```

This protects multi-scale FPF reasoning: a rate-change does not transfer across
levels merely because the same speed word appears at each level.

Goodhart / performative metric:

```text
Claim:
Velocity improved after it became the quarterly target.

C.27 reading:
`dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` may be live if metric publication or target use is a
temporal intervention. The central split is measurement, target/incentive,
real process change, and residual probe/frame/export cue.

Minimum useful note:
- metric measure: the published velocity/throughput reading, with C.16 relation if
  measurement legality or comparability is load-bearing;
- target/incentive use: quarterly target, gate, dashboard, budget signal, or
  public comparison;
- possible behavior change: smaller tickets, hidden work, quality reduction,
  deferred rework, selection of easier tasks;
- process-vs-measurement split: measurement/probe effect, real work change,
  gaming/selection effect, causal effect if claimed;
- E.13/proxy relation: proxy/utility distortion if velocity diverges from the
  actual work objective;
- C.26 relation: only if residual probe/frame/order/export cue remains after
  C.27/C.16/E.13 pattern relations;
- supported use: diagnostic investigation or metric design review;
- unsupported use: proof that the underlying work system improved.

```

This is the practical bridge between C.27, C.16, C.26, and evidence patterns.


### C.27:6 - Bias-Annotation

Use C.27 only where it improves FPF as a first-practical entry and pattern relation
pattern for temporal-claim adequacy. It is not enough for C.27 to be a correct
dynamic-claim schema. The useful result is that a cold reader can notice when a
state/rate reading is being used as a rate-change, rhythm-change, intervention,
braking, coasting, recovery, stabilization, benchmark, promise, or assurance
claim; choose the weakest honest next output; and stop or cite the carrying pattern without making
C.27 absorb that pattern's governed concern.

The missing-question content belongs here only where it strengthens
three practical abilities:

- how a reader finds C.27 from ordinary working language such as speed up, slow
  down, recover, stabilize, sustain cadence, improve faster, change direction,
  or reduce risk faster;
- how source ideas become FPF-facing guidance without turning physical or dynamic metaphors into new ontology: adopted, adapted,
  carried by another FPF pattern, or rejected as literal dynamics ontology;
- how C.27 keeps stronger claim relations with existing FPF patterns instead of
  becoming a general pattern for measurement, dynamics law, work, search,
  benchmarks, promises, assurance, viability, authored-unit drift, or QL.

Additional detail is useful only when it improves one of those three abilities
or clarifies a stopping condition. More fields, case notes, or pattern-relation prose is
rejected when they only make C.27 harder to refuse, harder to stop, or easier to
misread as a general theory of change.

**Gov.** C.27 reduces hidden decision-strength inflation: local diagnosis, planning basis, benchmark use, public promise, and assurance use remain different claim uses.

**Arch.** C.27 is biased against stealing work from neighbouring patterns. It types authored temporal-claim adequacy question while measurement, formal dynamics, work, search, benchmark, promise, causality, quality, value, viability, scale, adaptation, and QL relations remain with the patterns that govern those concerns.

**Onto/Epist.** C.27 is biased toward object/description/carrier separation and toward explicit claim posture. It treats Dyn0/Dyn1/Dyn2 as readings of authored temporal claims, not as kinds of systems.

**Prag/Did.** C.27 is biased toward cheap stopping, card-first use, and teaching through cases before field machinery. The first lesson is: a trend is not yet an intervention model.

### C.27:7 - Conformance Checklist

Use this checklist to inspect a C.27 record or C.27-facing paragraph. It does not ask each
ordinary C.27 use to fill a separate conformance form.

| Requirement | C.27 content |
| --- | --- |
| Applicability | A C.27 record exists only when the temporal distinction changes supported use, governing-pattern relation, evidence posture, or decision interpretation. |
| DynOrder | The body distinguishes state reading, rate reading, and intervention-sensitive rate-change/rhythm/regime reading. |
| Weakest output | The output is the weakest that changes use: no C.27 record, Dyn0 reading, Dyn1 reading, `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`, or formal-model relation. |
| Card minimum | A `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` names target, move, intervention, window, resistance/cost, basis, supported use, unsupported stronger use, and reopen/pattern-reference condition. |
| Boundary-crossing profile | `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` appears only when the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context into benchmark, publication, assurance, promise-like, gate, reusable method, cross-context, cross-scale, or formal/control use. |
| Governing-pattern relation | C.27 does not carry measurement, transition law, Work actuals, planning, causal/evaluation claim, benchmark parity, promise/boundary, assurance, or QL residue. |
| Stronger-use block | If supported use relies on measurement, causal attribution, benchmark parity, control/policy, cross-scale transfer, debt/hysteresis, promise, high-stakes temporal move, or QL residue, the corresponding governing-pattern relation or present profile block is named. |
| Profile-block closure | Every present block is defined by C.27, pattern-reference-only, or absent from `activeBlocks`; a block name is not a new governed object. |
| Pattern-relation economy | Add a C.27 relation note to another pattern only when that pattern has a concrete boundary reason to inspect temporal-claim adequacy; otherwise a C.27 card or profile cites the FPF pattern that carries the stronger question instead of creating a thin duplicate temporal record. |
| Exit | If no stronger use changes, the claim exits as ordinary prose, Dyn0/Dyn1 reading, C.16 measurement, `U.Dynamics`, or another governing pattern. |


**Value and harm boundary.** A temporally adequate claim is not automatically a
valuable claim. A valuable claim is not automatically temporally adequate. If
value, harm, safety, legal, ethics, quality, or promise impact is load-bearing,
C.27 states only the temporal move, window, supported use, unsupported stronger
use, and pattern relation. The value, harm, safety, legal, ethics, quality, or
promise pattern carries the stronger question.

**Conceptual lint classes (informative).** These labels describe cheap
inspection faults, not a required tool.

| Lint | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C27-KEYWORD-OVERREACH` | A speed/rhythm word creates a profile without a supported-use change. | Downgrade to ordinary prose, Dyn0, or Dyn1. |
| `C27-MISSING-CARD-MINIMUM` | Dyn2 card lacks target, move, intervention, window, resistance/cost, basis, supported use, or reopen condition. | Complete the card or downgrade. |
| `C27-PROFILE-WITHOUT-BOUNDARY-USE` | A profile is used for a local note. | Downgrade to a local card. |
| `C27-PATTERN-RELATION-THEFT` | C.27 carries measurement, dynamics-law, work, benchmark, promise, or QL content. | Keep that content with the pattern that carries the stronger question. |
| `C27-DYNORDER-AS-KIND` | Teams, systems, services, or methods become Dyn2 objects. | Repair to an authored-claim reading. |
| `C27-CAUSAL-LAUNDERING` | Rate changed after effort, therefore effort caused it. | Add causal/evaluation relation or mark causal use unsupported. |
| `C27-METRIC-TARGET-CONFLATION` | Metric improved, therefore the system improved. | Split measure, target pressure, work change, proxy distortion, and residual probe cue. |
| `C27-PROMISE-LAUNDERING` | Planning temporal claim becomes SLA, service guarantee, or commitment. | Keep promise/boundary/service content with the patterns that carry it. |

**Common failure modes after adoption (informative).**

| Failure mode | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Profile inflation | Every temporal phrase gets a profile; keep profile use for boundary-crossing claim use. |
| Pattern-relation theft | C.27 carries measurement, work, promise, benchmark, or QL; return the stronger question to the pattern that carries it. |
| Card laundering | A local card is cited as causal/evaluation claim, benchmark result, release approval, or service promise; mark that use unsupported. |
| DynOrder reification | A team or system becomes "Dyn2"; keep DynOrder as a reading of authored temporal claims. |
| Relation-note inflation | Every nearby pattern gets a C.27 note just in case; add a note only when the pattern must inspect temporal-claim adequacy directly. |

### C.27:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

C.27 starts with the anti-patterns most likely to make a working reader misuse a
state/rate reading as a Dyn2 temporal claim. Less frequent traps belong in the
extended bank and should not become a first-screen checklist.

| Core anti-pattern | What it looks like | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rate -> intervention laundering | "We measured throughput, therefore we know how to accelerate it." | Ask whether the claim is Dyn0 state, Dyn1 rate, or Dyn2 rate-change under effort/resistance/window; add only the weakest honest C.27 record. |
| Effort-free acceleration | "Velocity will double" with no effort, input, intervention actor/role, resistance proxy, window, evidence, or supported use. | Add a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or downgrade to Dyn1 measurement. |
| Past slope as control model | A historical trend is treated as a future intervention law. | Separate observed Dyn1 trend from Dyn2 intervention claim and formal-model relation. |
| C.27 as causal/evaluation claim | Rate changed after effort, therefore effort caused it. | Mark planning/diagnostic posture or include `dyn2CausalUseRoute?` with contrast/counterfactual, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, supported/unsupported causal use, and causal/evaluation pattern relation. |
| Rhythm as decoration | Rhythm names vibe/cadence with no bearer, anchor, window, proxy, evidence, or supported use. | Name bearer, anchor, window, instrument/evidence proxy, and supported use; add coupling/phase/entrainment only when the claim depends on a cross-bearer relation. |
| Metric-accelerated theater | The measured rate improves after becoming a target while hidden work worsens. | Separate real work-rate change, measurement/probe effect, gaming risk, and temporal intervention effect. |
| Aggregate acceleration laundering | Local speed or aggregate speed is laundered across levels. | Separate local bearer, aggregate bearer, mix shift, aggregation basis, and `dynamicTransferPosture`. |
| Acceleration bias | Faster is treated as better by default. | Make braking, pause, stabilization, redirection, coasting, and slower rollout legitimate outcomes. |

Use the negative cases to make non-use easy. They are not profile triggers.

| Negative case | Correct C.27 outcome |
| --- | --- |
| "This section accelerates orientation." | No C.27 record unless the authored unit uses that acceleration claim as the basis for a decision, promise, intervention, or comparison. |
| "The chart shows throughput rising." | Dyn1; C.16 only if the measurement construction is load-bearing. No C.27 record unless a rate-change intervention claim appears. |
| "The team has a strong rhythm." | No C.27 record unless rhythm carries a decision-use; then name bearer, anchor, window, evidence proxy, and supported use. |
| "We use a dashboard of velocity." | C.16/E.13/C.26.1 when the live issue is measurement, proxy distortion, or probe/publication effect; C.27 only when the dashboard is claimed to change a temporal outcome. |
| "The model is dynamic." | `U.Dynamics` when a state-space or transition law is being described; no C.27 record unless authored prose makes a rate-change adequacy claim. |
| "The agent used more calls." | C.24/work-trace relation; C.27 only when more calls are claimed to change debugging, search, learning, recovery, or stabilization rate. |
| "The process is agile." | A.6.P/local-head restoration first when "agile" is overloaded; C.27 only when braking, redirection, or rate-change question is live. |

Use the extended anti-patterns only when the live temporal claim actually raises
that trap.

| Extended anti-pattern | What it looks like | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keyword-triggered bureaucracy | Any speed, rhythm, agility, throughput, velocity, accelerate, or slow-down word forces a profile. | Use supported-use relevance, not keyword matching. |
| Derivative label without template | Acceleration, velocity, momentum, or cadence number lacks base characteristic, unit, scale, sampling window, method, and evidence. | Use C.16 measurement construction. |
| Rhythm bearer mismatch | Evidence from one bearer/window is applied to another. | Add bridge/evidence relation or mark transfer unsupported. |
| Effort window hidden in plan prose | Plan says "push harder" without WorkPlan, method, resource envelope, or actual burn evidence relation. | Attach planned effort to planning patterns and actual burn to work patterns. |
| Dynamics law as work log | Work trace or telemetry is treated as the law of change. | Keep `U.Dynamics` separate from `U.Work` evidence. |
| Agility as cornering speed | "Change direction fast" hides braking and redirection cost. | Name braking, redirection cost, intervention constraints, evidence, and supported use. |
| Premature convergence by acceleration | Faster narrowing collapses diversity, novelty, or frontier coverage. | Use C.17/C.18/C.19 as applicable and distinguish exploitation speed from healthy search. |
| Dyn2 profile as hidden promise | A planning note becomes a service guarantee, SLA-like statement, or public commitment. | Separate planning basis from promise content and boundary obligation. |
| Noisy acceleration worship | Small variation is overread as meaningful rate-change. | Widen sampling, add uncertainty, downgrade, or collect stronger evidence. |
| Tool-call acceleration theater | More calls or more context are treated as faster reasoning. | Name the target rate-change and stop/replan trigger. |
| Harmful acceleration | Work is accelerated while safety, ethics, legality, operational-support load, or human wellbeing becomes worse. | Use pattern-reference-only `dyn2HighStakesTemporalMoveRoute?` to name the high-stakes temporal move/window/unsupported use and cite the assurance, ethics, legal, safety, quality, or wellbeing pattern that carries the stronger question. |
| Coasting story without basis | Continued motion after effort stops is treated as free evidence of success. | Name coasting basis: habit, automation, stored work, learned capability, social norm, commitment momentum, physical inertia, queue pressure, or unknown. |
| Reversibility fantasy | Effort is removed and the system is assumed to return cleanly. | Include `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` only when supported use depends on residue/reversibility; record `unknown` if needed and bound supported use, with brake/recovery relation when load-bearing. |


### C.27:9 - Consequences

C.27 should make FPF better at planning and reviewing dynamic
claims while keeping ordinary state and rate claims cheap. Its main cost is one
more C-pattern and several pattern-preserving notes in existing FPF patterns. The mitigation is the
central affordability rule: C.27 must be easier not to use than to misuse.


C.27 claims decay over time. Refresh or reopen when:
Refresh posture stays proportional:

```text
Local C.27 card:
  has reopenTrigger only.

Boundary-crossing C.27 profile:
  has validityWindowRef and evidence valid_until when load-bearing.

Part G / benchmark / SoTA / public method claim:
  C.27 reopenTrigger feeds G.11 refresh orchestration;
  C.27 does not become a refresh ledger.
```


- sampling window, cadence, or time base changes;
- effort envelope or resource budget changes;
- intervention actor/role capacity, authority, or availability changes;
- inertia/resistance proxy changes: new tooling, team, queue topology, domain,
  work mix, constraints, or service environment;
- metric becomes a target, incentive, gate, dashboard, or public comparison;
- cross-scale transfer is attempted;
- outcome reverses, overshoots, oscillates, or becomes unstable;
- hidden queues, rework, burnout, quality loss, operational-support load, safety load, or
  coordination debt appear;
- rhythm bearer, anchor, window, proxy, or coupling changes;
- claim posture strengthens from assumption/diagnostic to benchmark, assurance,
  causal, promise-like, publication, or formal model use;
- the claim is reused outside its original validity window or domain;
- a coasting, braking, or recovery claim continues after effort changes or stops.

Local `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`s normally need only a reopen, downgrade,
or pattern-reference condition. `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`s for boundary-crossing claim use should cite
`validityWindowRef` or evidence `valid_until` when the claim carries a
benchmark, gate, assurance, promise-like use, reusable method, publication, or
formal-model relation. If rate-change evidence decays, freshness and epistemic-debt
handling belongs with B.3.4 or G.11 rather than becoming a C.27 freshness calculus.

When a Dyn2 benchmark, task-family adaptation claim, public method claim,
selector-facing claim, SoTA-bearing publication claim, or other Part G publication carries a
temporal-claim record, C.27 `reopenTrigger` is not enough by itself. C.27 states
the temporal-claim question and its validity/reopen basis; G.9 carries benchmark parity
when comparison is live; G.11 carries refresh orchestration such as refresh
queue, refresh plan, refresh report, deprecation notice, or edition bump when
evidence, comparator editions, method editions, claim windows, or validity
windows drift.

### C.27:10 - Rationale

The source article and source material are strongest where they replace
the question "what is the speed?" with "what effort profile, over which windows,
changes speed, rhythm, direction, or stability under resistance and cost?" The
C.27 keeps that practical move while rejecting physics ontology,
mandatory calculus, false QL relevance, and default full-profile
bureaucracy.


C.27 acts in FPF as a small modern correction for one recurring failure:
working texts observe or name a rate and then behave as if they know how to
change that rate. The pattern brings FPF up to modern practice only in the
following shape:

- the state/rate/rate-change distinction remains the cheap recognition gain;
- control, policy evaluation, causal inference, process mining, benchmarking,
  rhythm, and high-stakes temporal-move cases appear as present profile blocks;
- quantum-like residual cases appear only as C.26 relations, not as C.27 claim-adequacy content
  blocks or fields of one universal dynamic object;
- control fields stay absent by default and appear only for control-style use;
- behavior-policy versus evaluation-policy discipline is visible when
  off-policy or sequential-policy transfer is claimed;
- causal claims carry intervention contrast, time zero, follow-up, outcome,
  assumptions, and identification/evaluation relation rather than C.27 shorthand;
- performative and Goodhart cases separate metric-as-measure,
  metric-as-target, and metric-as-intervention;
- workflow/process claims name bearer, object/event trace, interaction, and
  convergence/divergence rather than one generic process-speed label;
- dynamic benchmarks use C.27 to type the temporal-claim question while G.9 carries
  parity;
- rhythm claims stay bearer+anchor+window+basis+supported-use by default, with
  stronger entrainment/coupling only when the claim needs it;
- quantum-like use stays out of C.27 unless a residual probe/order/frame/export
  cue remains after ordinary C.27, C.24, C.16, G.9, and E.13 pattern relations;
- full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`s remain rare, and the pattern improves action quality more than
  it increases paperwork.

One-line SoTA formulation for C.27: it makes
intervention-sensitive temporal claims explicit - policy, effort, window,
resistance, feedback, evidence, bearer, and supported use - while refusing to
treat every speed/rhythm phrase as control theory, causal/evaluation claim, benchmark
superiority, or quantum-like modeling.

### C.27:11 - SoTA-Echoing

C.27 should be shaped by current modeling practice without becoming a survey
paper. The C.27 SoTA posture is: C.27 is intervention-sensitive temporal
claim adequacy with explicit epistemic/claim posture, not literal second
derivative everywhere and not universal control theory.

Source binding used by this section:

| Source line | C.27 use | Adopt / adapt / reject posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `D2-SRC-1` - the source article on state, first-derivative dynamics, second-derivative dynamics, effort intervals, and rhythm practice. | Sets the working question: are we only reading speed/rhythm, or claiming that effort over time changes speed/rhythm? | Adopt the question shift and dance/practice usability examples; adapt physical vocabulary into authored temporal-claim adequacy; reject new Kernel `force`, `mass`, `acceleration`, or `rhythm` kinds. |
| `D2-SRC-2` - learning-based MPC and engineering MPC practice. | Disciplines control-style temporal claims with horizon, constraints, uncertainty, feedback update, and stability only when control language is live. | Adapt into optional `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?`; reject making every Dyn2 card a control model. |
| `D2-SRC-3` - safe RL, off-policy evaluation, conservative/offline RL, and dynamic treatment-regime practice. | Disciplines policy/regime transfer, policy-overlap, unsafe exploration, behavior policy, evaluation policy, and repeated intervention timing. | Adapt into `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` when a policy/regime claim is live; reject policy-transfer evidence basis from one observed slope alone. |
| `D2-SRC-4` - causal inference for intervention effects. | Separates planning/diagnostic Dyn2 claims from causal effect claims. | Adopt causal question, comparator/counterfactual, estimand, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, and evidence-design discipline for `dyn2CausalUseRoute?`; reject causal/evaluation claim completion inside C.27 itself. |
| `D2-SRC-5` - performative prediction and Goodhart variants. | Shows that metric publication, target use, incentives, or gates may change behavior rather than merely report it. | Adapt into `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?`; C.16 carries measurement, E.13/assurance carries proxy distortion, and C.26 carries residual probe/frame/export cues; reject a generic Goodhart catch-all. |
| `D2-SRC-6` - object-centric process mining and object-centric event logs. | Shows why scalar throughput often hides multiple object bearers, event traces, interactions, and aggregation risks. | Adapt into `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` and object-centric trace requirements; reject one scalar rate as whole workflow truth when multi-object interaction is live. |
| `D2-SRC-7` - active inference / active sensing practice. | Reminds C.27 that measurement can be action, while ordinary FPF pattern relations remain primary. | Adapt as a local relation test for measurement, state-space, planning, evidence, control, causal, or process-log basis; reject automatic QL relevance from planned measurement or typed states. |
| `D2-SRC-8` - rhythm, beat synchronization, groove, entrainment, and compliant-system timing work. | Disciplines rhythm claims with bearer, anchor, window, proxy/evidence, and supported use; coupling/phase/entrainment appear only for stronger cross-bearer claims. | Adapt into rhythm fields on `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; reject a standalone `U.Rhythm` kind or decorative rhythm vocabulary. |

SoTA lesson -> FPF obligation map:

| Modern lesson | C.27 obligation | Pattern that carries the stronger question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MPC/control practice separates horizon, constraints, uncertainty, and feedback update. | Name control horizon/update only when the temporal claim is control-style. | `A.3.3 U.Dynamics`, C.16, C.19/C.24, evidence/assurance patterns. |
| OPE/safe RL separates behavior policy, evaluation policy, policy overlap, and unsafe-exploration risk. | Do not transfer evidence from policy A to policy B without behavior/evaluation policy and `offPolicyRisk`. | `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` plus evaluation/control relations. |
| Causal inference separates intervention timing, comparator/counterfactual, estimand, follow-up, assumptions, and rival causes. | Keep planning/diagnostic Dyn2 distinct from causal/evaluation claim. | Causal/evaluation/evidence patterns. |
| Performative prediction and Goodhart variants show that published targets can change behavior. | Split metric-as-measure, target/incentive use, temporal intervention, and proxy distortion. | C.16, E.13/assurance, C.26 only for residual probe/frame cue. |
| Object-centric process mining shows scalar throughput can hide multi-object interaction. | Recover object types, event trace, interaction note, and aggregation basis when process speed is load-bearing. | Local process evidence/OCPM discipline plus C.27 object-centric trace block. |
| Rhythm research treats rhythm as bearer/anchor/window/proxy/coupling-if-live. | Keep cadence/rhythm claims tied to bearer, anchor, evidence, supported use, and optional coupling only when cross-bearer relation matters. | C.27 rhythm card plus C.16/evidence when measured. |
| Scaling-law practice separates scale variable, scale window, probe, and elasticity. | Do not infer linear improvement from more data, tokens, calls, reviewers, or capacity. | C.18.1 and G.9 when compared. |
| Benchmark practice needs parity pins, baselines, freshness, budgets, and comparator editions. | Do not read faster improvement as benchmark superiority without parity plan/report. | G.9. |

Control and MPC. Control-style claims need horizon, constraints, uncertainty,
feedback update, and stability only when control language is live. A local
`Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` can say "we plan to brake rollout for two weeks to protect operational-support
capacity" without becoming MPC. If the claim is not control-style, do not fill
control fields. A control claim used beyond the local working context needs the stronger pattern relation.

C.27 control/policy relation: `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` is present only when
`dynClaimPosture` is `controlModel`, `policyRule`, `adaptive`, a feedback-bearing
`planningModel`, or an explicit C.24/C.19/evaluation relation. The block says that
the temporal claim has crossed into control/policy claim-use; it does not make
C.27 an MPC, reinforcement-learning, or policy-evaluation pattern.

Sequential decision and reinforcement-learning practice. Many real rate-change
claims are policy/regime claims, not one-shot effort claims. Policy-transfer
control/policy details live inside `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?`, not in the default
`Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`. When live, the block should recover behavior policy, evaluation policy,
overlap note, uncertainty or bound reference, unsafe-exploration note,
and pattern reference to C.19, C.24, `U.Dynamics`, or the evaluation pattern. This matters for
adaptive rollouts, agentic tool-use, clinical-like treatment regimes, and
repeated operational interventions.

Causal inference. C.27 is not a causal/evaluation claim pattern. Effort plus observed rate-change may
carry a planning or diagnostic reading, but a causal attribution needs a separate
causal/evaluation relation. When `dyn2CausalUseRoute?` is present, it should name the causal question,
intervention reference, comparator or counterfactual, estimand, time-zero or
assignment window, follow-up window, outcome measure, assumptions, rival causes,
identification strategy or evidence design when available, supported causal use,
and unsupported causal use.

Core rule: C.27 can say a claim is Dyn2 and intervention-sensitive. C.27 cannot
turn that basis into a causal/evaluation claim with estimand and identification/evaluation relation. Dyn2 can describe an intervention-sensitive
temporal-claim question; it does not estimate causal effect unless `dyn2CausalUseRoute?`
is active and causal/evaluation discipline carries the causal question.

Performative prediction, Goodhart, and metric-induced behavior. When a metric
becomes a target, dashboard, incentive, gate, or public comparison, it may
change behavior. C.27 should branch the case instead of becoming a Goodhart
pattern.

`C.27:4 - Solution` defines the `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` fields; this
section explains why metric publication and target use must be split from
measurement legality, proxy distortion, and residual probe/frame cue.

Content split:
- C.16 carries metric-as-measure;
- E.13, assurance, or governance patterns carry metric-as-target, incentive,
  proxy, utility distortion, or optimization target;
- metric publication as temporal intervention may make C.27 relevant;
- C.26 carries metric/probe changes to the lawful state reading only if residual
  probe/frame/order/export cue remains after ordinary C.27/C.16/E.13 pattern relations are
  named.

This keeps Goodhart from becoming a catch-all warning and keeps C.27 focused on
the dynamic effect of metric publication or metric-target use.

Process mining and object-centric process mining. Scalar throughput is often a
thin view. Some dynamic claims need trace topology, multiple object bearers,
interaction notes, and evidence about how queues, tickets, incidents, customers,
orders, services, engineers, deployments, or review windows interact. When this question is live, `C.27:4 - Solution` defines the
`dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` fields. This section explains why multi-object
trace requirements should be named instead of pretending that one scalar
throughput rate says enough.

Active sensing and active inference. Measurement may be an action rather than a
passive read, but that is still usually ordinary FPF pattern relations: measurement,
state-space, planning, evidence, control, causal, or process-log basis. QL is
not made relevant by typing, discreteness, state reduction, tokenization, or planned
measurement. C.27 may notice dynamic or probe pressure, but it must not promote
active inference, quantum cognition, or QL mathematics unless C.26 remains
relevant after ordinary-pattern exit tests.

Rhythm and embodied dynamics. Load-bearing rhythm claims need bearer, anchor,
window, basis, and supported use. Coupling, phase relation, entrainment-like
relation, perturbation response, tempo drift, or synchronization evidence are
stronger-use fields only when the claim depends on coordination between bearers.
This preserves the useful dance/practice analogy without minting a rhythm
ontology.

C.27 is a middle recognition-and-relation lens, not a general dynamic-theory
pattern. It notices when a claim has moved from state/rate reading to
intervention-sensitive temporal adequacy, then keeps stronger claim relations with
the existing FPF pattern that carries them:

| Claim question noticed by C.27 | Existing FPF pattern relation |
| --- | --- |
| lawful measurement or comparable rate/rate-change reading | `C.16` |
| transition law, reusable dynamics model, prediction, simulation, or control model | `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` plus evidence/assurance patterns |
| actual work/effort trace or resource burn | `U.Work` / `Gamma_work` |
| scale-variable or elasticity claim | `C.18.1` scaling-law lens |
| search policy, exploration/exploitation, premature narrowing, convergence health | `C.19` |
| agentic tool-use planning or tool-call rate-change | `C.24` call-planning discipline |
| task-family learning/adaptation speed or time-to-usable specialization | `C.22.1` task-family adaptation signature |
| viability-envelope temporal regulation | `C.26.3` viability-envelope boundary regulation |
| reproducible dynamic benchmark or faster-improvement comparison | `G.9` |
| causal/evaluation claim or effect estimate | causal/evaluation/evidence patterns |
| promise, SLA/SLO, gate, public commitment, release claim | promise, boundary, service, and assurance patterns |
| residual probe/frame/export/coarsening/order-effect cue | `C.26` |

The following lines connect common failures to C.27 action, not to a literature catalog:

| Popular failure | Modern correction | C.27 action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Past slope is treated as a future control law. | Control/policy claims need horizon, update rule, constraints, and evidence/model relation. | If local, make a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; if reusable/control-bearing, include `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` and cite `U.Dynamics`, C.16, and assurance patterns as the carriers of the stronger question. |
| Data from one policy/regime is used to justify another. | OPE/RL practice asks behavior policy, evaluation policy, policy-overlap, uncertainty, and unsafe-exploration risk. | Keep ordinary `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` cheap; include `dyn2ControlPolicyRoute?` only when policy transfer is load-bearing. |
| One effort impulse is treated as the whole dynamic regime. | Dynamic-treatment/regime practice treats some interventions as sequences of decision rules. | Record policy/regime only in active block; do not make every Dyn2 a policy model. |
| Rate changed after effort, so effort caused it. | Causal inference needs contrast/counterfactual, estimand, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, and design. | Mark planning/diagnostic posture or include `dyn2CausalUseRoute?`; causal/evaluation discipline carries the causal/evaluation claim. |
| Metric improves after publication, so process improved. | Performative/Goodhart cases split measurement, target/incentive/proxy distortion, temporal intervention, and residual probe/frame/export effects. | Include `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` only for temporal intervention/supported-use change; C.16 carries measurement, E.13/assurance carries proxy distortion, and C.26 carries residual probe/frame/export cue. |
| Scalar throughput is read as whole workflow truth. | OCPM/process mining separates object bearers, event traces, interactions, and aggregation. | Include `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` / `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` only when scalar rate is insufficient. |
| Measurement-as-action triggers QL too early. | Active sensing may matter, but ordinary FPF pattern relations come first. | Keep C.27 ordinary; treat QL as C.26 content only after ordinary-pattern exits. |
| Rhythm is decorative cadence/vibe. | Rhythm work needs bearer, anchor, window, basis/proxy, and supported use; coupling is stronger-use only. | Use `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; include coupling/phase/entrainment only when the claim depends on cross-bearer relation. |


### C.27:12 - Relations

C.27 is the pattern for authored temporal-claim adequacy. It asks whether a
claim about speed, rhythm, throughput, recovery, convergence, rollout, adoption,
braking, coasting, redirection, or stabilization is strong enough for the use
being made of it. It does not become the pattern for the described system, work,
measurement, benchmark, promise, quality bundle, or formal dynamics model.

When a temporal claim also touches another FPF concern, use the FPF pattern that
governs that concern and let C.27 state only the temporal-claim adequacy question.

| Related FPF pattern or discipline | Use C.27 for | Keep in that pattern or discipline |

| --- | --- | --- |
| C.27 itself | First-use entry and exit rule; Dyn0/Dyn1/Dyn2 distinction; weakest-output ladder; `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` for boundary-crossing claim use; anti-patterns; refresh/reopen triggers. | Nothing outside C.27 is needed when the claim remains only a local temporal-claim adequacy question. |
| `C.16` | Naming the rate, rate-change, rhythm, recovery, or intervention-effect requirement that the measure is being asked to carry. | Measurement construction, evidence, comparability, units, sampling windows, and lawful metric use. |
| `C.26` | Keeping ordinary dynamics, measurement, work-effort, rhythm, braking, coasting, and intervention-timing questions outside QL before any residual QL cue is considered. | Residual probe/frame/order/export/coarsening cue after ordinary C.27/C.16/work/benchmark/proxy pattern relations. |
| `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` | Deciding that an authored temporal claim has become strong enough to need a reusable transition-law, simulation, prediction, formal model, or calibrated control relation. | State space, transition law, observation/model constraints, validity discipline, simulation, prediction, and calibrated control model semantics. |
| `A.19` and `C.16` together | Showing that derivative-like wording needs base characteristic, scale/unit, time base or sampling window, construction method, evidence, and supported use. | Characteristic-space legality and measurement construction. C.27 does not create a parallel coordinate system. |
| `B.1.4` and `B.1.6` | Preventing temporal slices, phase names, work logs, resource burn, or effort traces from being read as acceleration or transition laws. | Temporal-slice composition, phase composition, work/resource aggregation, and actual work evidence. |
| `B.1.5` and `B.2.4` | Naming the temporal-claim adequacy question only when method composition, work enactment, adaptive workflow, or capability-emergence prose also claims faster/slower improvement, recovery, stabilization, braking, or rhythm change. | Order-sensitive method composition, work enactment, adaptive workflow, and meta-functional transition. C.27 does not become a method-composition or emergence pattern. |
| `A.4` / `B.4` / `A.16` / `B.4.1` | Naming a temporal-claim adequacy question inside lifecycle, evolution-loop, cue-stabilization, reopen, operationalize, retire, or language-state movement prose. | Temporal duality, canonical evolution loops, language-state move legality, and observe-notice-stabilize relation discipline. C.27 does not become a lifecycle or language-state movement pattern. |
| `C.24` | Tool-use plans whose tool-call sequence is claimed to change debugging speed, repair rate, learning rate, candidate discovery, evidence confirmation, bug localization, rollout stabilization, or uncertainty reduction. | Call planning, tool-use sequence, and work trace. More calls or more context are not dynamic improvement by themselves. |
| `C.17` and `C.18` | Naming the temporal-claim adequacy question only when a creativity, novelty, open-ended search, archive-growth, illumination, or candidate-generation claim also claims faster/slower improvement, coverage, discovery, or convergence. | Creativity characteristics, novelty/value measurement, NQD generation/update/illumination/select-front calculus, archive semantics, and provenance pins. |
| `C.19` | Convergence, narrowing, widening, exploration, exploitation, or search-speed question when that temporal reading changes supported use. | Pool-policy result and explore/exploit governance. |
| `C.18.1` | A scale-variable change used as the basis for rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization. | Scale variables, scale windows, scale probes, elasticity posture, and scaling-law adequacy. |
| `C.22.1` | Learning or adaptation-rate question for a declared `TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`. | Task-family adaptation signature, threshold target, prior exposure, transfer, retention, and corridor-entry evidence. |
| `C.26.3` | Braking, throttling, cadence change, recovery timing, adaptation cost, or stabilization as a temporal move inside a viability-envelope claim. | Viability bearer, protected promise/function, viable region, disturbance, sensor/probe/action split, adaptation cost, and failure mode. |
| `E.13` | Naming when a temporal metric, proxy, or dashboard trend is being treated as practical value or target. | Pragmatic utility, value alignment, proxy audit, and Goodhart repair. C.27 does not decide value adequacy. |
| `E.16` | Naming the temporal-claim adequacy question when autonomy budgets, guard cadence, ledger evidence, depletion, override, or freedom-of-action language is used as the basis for acceleration, braking, recovery, or stabilization. | Autonomy budget declaration, guard checks, autonomy ledger, depletion behavior, pause/resume speech acts, and scale policy under autonomy. |
| `A.10` / `B.3` / `B.3.4` / `G.6` | Naming which temporal reading needs an evidence basis, provenance path, assurance posture, freshness window, decay note, or reopen condition. | Evidence graph referring, evidence carriers, provenance anchors, assurance posture, evidence decay / epistemic debt, and citable path/slice discipline. |
| `G.9` | Dynamic benchmark requirement: rate-change, rhythm change, recovery speed, intervention effect, effort budget, or dynamic outcome. | Baseline, freshness, comparator, bridge discipline, parity plan, parity report, and reproducible benchmark publication. |
| `C.25` | Dynamic quality-family slot when agility, resilience, adaptability, recovery, or robustness depends on braking, redirection, stabilization, recovery rate, or rhythm under effort. | Quality-family bundle structure, scope, measures, mechanisms, evidence, and endpoint discipline. |
| `G.5` | Only the selector-publication case where a selector report consumes a dynamic benchmark result. | Method-family registry use and selector publication. C.27 does not add a default G.5 object. |
| `A.2.3` / `A.2.8` / `A.2.9` / `A.6.C` / `F.12` and assurance patterns | Promise-like or boundary-facing temporal claims: release speed, recovery guarantee, SLA/SLO-like cadence, public commitment, gate, service acceptance, or assurance use. | Promise content, commitments, instituting speech acts, contract unpacking, service acceptance binding, assurance posture, and release/gate evidence. |
| `E.18 E.TGA` / `A.20` / `A.21` | Naming the C.27 temporal-claim adequacy question when a flow, gate, crossing, `PathSlice`, `LaunchGate`, or published decision uses that temporal claim. | The TGA carcass: `U.Transfer`, `OperationalGate(profile)`, GateCheck publication shape, `ConstraintValidity`, `GateFit`, `DecisionLog`, `PathSlice`/sentinel refresh, `Gamma_time` pins, `SquareLaw`, and crossing visibility. |
| `C.21` / `G.10` / `G.11` / `G.12` | Naming the temporal claim when a discipline-health value, shipped pack, dashboard time-series, telemetry pin, RSCR trigger, refresh plan, refresh report, or dashboard slice is read as evidence for improvement, decay, recovery, stabilization, or rate-change. | Discipline-health slot meaning, SoTA pack shipping, DHC series/row/slice construction, telemetry-pin publication, refresh/decay orchestration, and RSCR trigger discipline. |
| Causal/evaluation patterns | A rate-change, intervention, effort, workshop, policy, or practice change is used as a causal-use basis. | Causal question, contrast/counterfactual, estimand, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, identification strategy, and evidence design. |

Use pattern references before expanding a C.27 record. When measurement,
transition law, work evidence, planning, benchmark parity, causal/evaluation
claim, promise content, assurance posture, quality, viability, or residual QL
discipline carries the stronger question, the C.27 record cites that pattern and
keeps only the temporal-claim adequacy question.

For C.27 relations to stay pattern-preserving, check:


1. Does any field imply a new Kernel kind?
2. Does C.27 steal state-space, measurement, transition-law, work, planning,
   benchmark, causal, promise, service, quality-bundle, publication, or QL
   pattern relation from the FPF pattern that governs that question?
3. Are described entity, temporal bearer, profile content, and profile carrier
   kept distinct?
4. Are words such as process, workflow, practice, service, method, system, and
   rhythm resolved through existing FPF patterns where load-bearing?
5. Are derivative-like readings C.16-compliant?
6. Are full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`s rare and justified rather than default?
7. Does at least one golden case correctly exit or downgrade from Dyn2?
8. Does the text make braking, pause, stabilization, redirection, and coasting
   first-class rather than treating acceleration as the default good?
9. Does the text avoid QL relevance unless ordinary pattern relations leave residual
   probe/frame/export/coarsening cue?
10. Does a causal, benchmark, promise-like, or assurance claim have a stronger
    pattern relation than an ordinary `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`?

At use time, the concrete relation is enough: name the temporal-claim adequacy
question, name the pattern that carries the stronger question, state the
unsupported stronger use, and choose the weaker C.27 output or the cited stronger
pattern relation.

This informative matrix states C.27 non-contradiction boundaries. Ordinary C.27 use does not fill it as a form.


| Existing FPF discipline / dynamic collision theme | C.27 relation | Collision risk | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A.7 strict distinction | C.27 records are authored descriptions of temporal-claim adequacy. | Card/profile content is confused with the described object, work, dynamics law, or carrier. | Keep object, temporal-claim description, and carrier distinct in C.27 and in any neighboring C.27 relation text. |
| E.10 / F.5 / F.8 naming discipline | C.27 uses local labels and Plain/Tech mapping. | Dyn2, rhythm, force, inertia, speed, or acceleration become new FPF kinds. | Use pattern-local dynamic-claim labels; introduce no new `U.*` kind and no pattern-number-prefixed term. |
| A.3.3 `U.Dynamics` | C.27 types the authored temporal-claim adequacy question before a stronger formal-model relation is needed. | C.27 steals transition law, simulation, prediction, or reusable control model work. | Keep formal laws, simulations, predictions, and calibrated control models with `U.Dynamics` and evidence/assurance patterns. |
| A.19 `CharacteristicSpace` | C.27 may point to base characteristic, state reading, rate reading, or rate-change reading. | C.27 informally creates derivative coordinates or spaces. | Use A.19 and C.16 for characteristic-space and measure construction when the reading is load-bearing. |
| C.16 MM-CHR | C.27 cites measures, rate readings, rate-change readings, and evidence. | C.27 invents measurement legality or comparability. | C.16 carries measurement construction; C.27 only names the temporal-claim question and cites the measurement relation. |
| A.15 / `U.Work` / WorkPlan / MethodDescription | C.27 relates effort timing, intervention, resource envelope, and work trace to a temporal claim. | C.27 stores actual work, assigns plan authority, or treats planned effort as performed work. | Planning/method description carries planned effort; work evidence carries actuals; C.27 records only the temporal-claim adequacy question. |
| B.1.5 / B.2.4 | C.27 can type the temporal adequacy question when method-composition or capability-emergence prose also claims rate, rhythm, recovery, stabilization, braking, or redirection. | C.27 becomes a method-composition, work-enactment, or emergence pattern. | B.1.5 carries order-sensitive method composition and work enactment; B.2.4 carries meta-functional transition. |
| A.4 / B.4 / A.16 / B.4.1 | C.27 can type the temporal adequacy question inside lifecycle, evolution-loop, cue-stabilization, reopen, operationalize, retire, or language-state movement prose. | C.27 becomes a lifecycle, evolution-loop, language-state movement, or cue-stabilization pattern. | Those patterns carry lifecycle/evolution and language-state movement; C.27 only states the temporal claim and its supported/unsupported use. |
| C.18.1 | C.27 can type temporal-claim question when a scale-variable change is used as the basis for rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization. | C.27 becomes a scaling-law or elasticity pattern. | C.18.1 carries scale variables, scale windows, scale probes, and elasticity posture; C.27 only states temporal-claim adequacy. |
| C.17 / C.18 | C.27 can type the temporal adequacy question inside creativity, novelty, open-ended search, archive-growth, illumination, or candidate-generation prose. | C.27 becomes a creativity, novelty, or NQD-calculus pattern. | C.17 carries creativity characteristics and novelty/value measurement; C.18 carries NQD generation, archive, illumination, and selection calculus. |
| C.19 | C.27 can type convergence, narrowing, exploration, exploitation, or search-speed question. | C.27 becomes a pool-policy result pattern. | C.19 carries pool-policy result; C.27 only states temporal-claim question when speed/change affects supported use. |
| C.24 | C.27 can flag tool-use acceleration, repair-rate, learning-rate, or stabilization claims. | C.24 is asked to carry C.27 fields whenever tool-use prose mentions speed. | Use a C.27 card/profile reference first; add local C.24 fields only if repeated concrete cases show that C.24 itself must inspect the temporal-claim question. |
| C.22.1 | C.27 can type learning/adaptation-rate question for one declared `TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`. | C.27 becomes a generic learning-speed or specialization pattern. | C.22.1 carries the task-family adaptation signature; C.27 only states the temporal-claim question when it changes supported use. |
| C.26.3 | C.27 can type braking, throttling, cadence, recovery, or stabilization claim inside a viability-envelope claim. | C.27 becomes a viability-envelope or stability-through-change pattern. | C.26.3 carries the viability-envelope record; C.27 only states the temporal move and pattern relation. |
| E.13 | C.27 can flag a temporal metric, proxy, dashboard trend, or target-effect reading. | C.27 becomes value-alignment or proxy-audit law. | E.13 carries pragmatic utility, value alignment, and proxy audit; C.27 only states the temporal claim. |
| E.16 | C.27 can flag temporal adequacy inside autonomy-budget, guard-cadence, depletion, pause/resume, or freedom-of-action language. | C.27 becomes autonomy governance or guard-budget law. | E.16 carries autonomy budget declarations, guard checks, autonomy ledger, depletion behavior, and override speech acts. |
| G.9 | C.27 can flag dynamic benchmark parity requirement. | C.27 becomes the benchmark parity harness. | G.9 carries baseline, freshness, comparator, bridge, parity plan, and parity report discipline; C.27 names only the dynamic claim question. |
| A.10 / B.3 / B.3.4 / G.6 | C.27 can name evidence basis, provenance path, freshness/decay posture, and reopen condition for a temporal claim. | C.27 becomes evidence graph, assurance, decay, or provenance law. | A.10, B.3, B.3.4, and G.6 carry those evidence/provenance/assurance questions; C.27 only names the temporal reading that needs them. |
| C.21 / G.10 / G.11 / G.12 | C.27 can flag the temporal claim inside discipline-health values, pack shipping, dashboard telemetry, refresh triggers, RSCR inputs, or dashboard slices. | C.27 becomes discipline-health characterization, SoTA pack shipping, dashboard, or refresh orchestration. | C.21 carries discipline-health slot meaning; G.10 carries pack shipping; G.12 carries dashboard time-series and telemetry-pin publication; G.11 carries refresh/decay orchestration. |
| C.26 | C.27 carries ordinary temporal adequacy before QL is considered. | Dyn2 vocabulary escalates into quantum-like modeling. | C.26 applies only for residual probe/frame/order/export/coarsening cue after ordinary C.27/C.16/work/benchmark/proxy pattern relations. |
| A.2.3 / A.2.8 / A.2.9 / A.6.C / F.12 and assurance patterns | C.27 may flag promise-like, boundary-facing, or service-acceptance temporal claims. | C.27 becomes an SLA, commitment, instituting speech-act, boundary-semantics, service-acceptance, or assurance pattern. | Those patterns carry promise content, commitment, speech act, contract unpacking, service acceptance, and assurance; C.27 only states the temporal claim and its supported/unsupported use. |

Core discipline: C.27 does not name new objects in the world. It names when an
authored temporal claim has started to need intervention-sensitive temporal
adequacy, then keeps each stronger claim relation with the FPF pattern that already
governs that concern.




Practitioner-readable problem:

One-minute working script:

> When a text says something should get faster, slower, recover, stabilize, or
> keep rhythm, first ask: are we only reading a state, only reading a rate, or
> claiming that an intervention changes the rate, rhythm, recovery, or

C.27 also carries an early non-improvement boundary:

> C.27 is not a temporal theory of everything.
> It is the smallest useful repair for one recurring authored-claim failure:
> rate talk pretending to know rate-change.

C.27 does not present itself as improving all temporal reasoning, all
process modeling, all practice description, all rhythm theory, all
control/RL/causal inference, all performance management, all QL or
active-inference modeling, all scaling claims, or all adaptation claims. It
improves one narrow working failure: it prevents state/rate readings from being
laundered into intervention-sensitive temporal claims without effort, window,
resistance, basis, and supported/unsupported-use discipline.

The first C.27 record should be the one-screen `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, not a full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`.
The `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` is a boundary-crossing claim-use C.27 record. Existing formal patterns carry formal models; a C.27 record cites them when the stronger question is live instead of copying C.27 theory into another pattern relation.



The durable bottom line is:

> C.27 strengthens FPF only if it improves first-practical entry and pattern relation:
> it notices state/rate-to-rate-change laundering, produces the weakest honest
> next output, and keeps every stronger claim relation with the existing FPF pattern
> that governs that concern.

It should help FPF users act more carefully with speed, rhythm, effort,
inertia, braking, coasting, and redirection claims. It does not make FPF carry
mathematical theater, physics ontology, false QL relevance, or a hidden
compliance backpack.
