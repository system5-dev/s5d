## C.26.1 - Probe-Coupled Boundary Interaction

> Type: Architectural pattern
> Status: Stable
> Normativity: Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### C.26.1:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a boundary read, meeting, metric, API read, dashboard, workshop, survey, split, bridge, or message is being used as if it merely revealed or transferred state, but the probe or interaction changes the represented state enough to alter the architecture decision.

This is the main everyday entry into the QL cluster. It is useful because many teams already know how to talk about boundaries, interfaces, metrics, and workshops. The missing move is to notice when the act of reading or crossing the boundary participates in the state being read.

| Working surface | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary reader | Architect, platform lead, domain modeler, or manager judging a boundary read, workshop, dashboard, metric, API read, or bridge result. |
| Governed object | A boundary interaction being used as evidence, export, comparison, or decision input. |
| Governed move | Replace false passive-read or unjustified lossless-transfer wording with a probe-coupled boundary decision and reroute where needed. |
| Outside work | Ordinary message passing, ordinary causal intervention, ordinary API semantics, bridge loss alone, and generic relation-token minting. |
| What changes in practice | The team records what the probe changed before using its output as architecture evidence. |

Plain glosses:
- `passive read`: treating a workshop, metric, dashboard, API read, survey, or message as if it only reports state.
- `probe-coupled`: the read/export/intervention participates in the represented state enough to change the lawful decision.
- `coupling channel`: the concrete workshop, metric, message, API, dashboard, meeting, bridge, or event stream through which the effect travels.
- `export loss`: what the carried output cannot faithfully carry into another context or decision.

### C.26.1:2 - Problem

Architecture work often treats boundary interactions as passive. A dashboard "shows readiness". A workshop "discovers the context map". An API read "returns state". A meeting "collects alignment". A message "transfers a decision".

Sometimes that is good enough. Sometimes it is false for the current decision. Publishing the dashboard changes readiness behavior. Running the workshop changes alignment and local meaning. Reading the API changes timing assumptions. Sending the message changes trust, escalation, or error handling. Splitting the service changes the viability envelope that the split was meant to optimize.

When the false passive reading survives, the team may keep the wrong boundary, trust the wrong export, combine incomparable outputs, or redesign the system around an artifact that partly created what it reports.

### C.26.1:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Boundary discipline vs probe sensitivity | `A.6` and `F.9` already govern boundaries and bridges; this pattern adds only the state-changing or export-changing probe burden. |
| Intervention vs readout | Many actions change the world ordinarily. QL is active only when the action is being used as a read, export, comparison, or optimization of the state it changes. |
| Lean use vs evidence strength | A working team needs a small card; release, audit, or measurement claims need evidence and measurement owners. |
| Coupling words vs relation tokens | Words such as coupling, interaction, and export are plain explanatory wording until `A.6.P` / `F.18` ratifies a reusable relation token. |

### C.26.1:4 - Solution

Before accepting a passive read or unjustified lossless-transfer reading, ask whether the probe or interaction changed what the output may lawfully mean.

C.26.1 is active only when the interaction both participates in the represented state and its output is being used as evidence, export, comparison input, or decision input as if it were passive. Mere behavior change, ordinary feedback, or ordinary influence is not enough.

A probe-coupled interaction may be useful and intentionally state-shaping. The repair is not to avoid it; the repair is to stop using its output as if it were a neutral pre-probe read.

Start with this recognition note:

| Mini-entry | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary owner | Which ordinary FPF pattern already carries the baseline boundary, bridge, measurement, work, or viability burden? |
| False passive read | Which reading would be false: "the dashboard, workshop, API read, survey, message, or bridge just reports state"? |
| Probe effect | What changed because of the probe, intervention, export, order, frame, or boundary crossing? |
| Practical change | What does the team do differently now: mark probe-coupled, redesign the probe/order/frame, rewrite bridge/export, add evidence, or reroute? |
| Stop / reroute | Which stronger use is unsupported by this note, and which FPF pattern carries that stronger burden? |

Use the fuller decision-bearing record below when the boundary result will be reused, contested, used as evidence, or used to change an architecture decision.

Full decision-bearing record:

| Field | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Boundary | Which boundary, role relation, authority relation, context bridge, service interface, team boundary, or system edge is crossed or queried? |
| Probe or interaction | Which workshop, dashboard, API read, metric, meeting, survey, message, event stream, or other typed probe lane is active? |
| QL cue / formal cue | Which instrument-like update, order/frame sensitivity, incompatible-probe structure, no faithful-enough export under the declared probe/frame/use, or mutual interaction whose local reads/exports are no longer lawfully comparable or reusable without declaring the probe/frame/update relation makes ordinary passive-read wording false? |
| False passive reading | What discovery, neutral observation, one-way transfer, or unjustified lossless-message reading would be false? |
| Pre-probe hypothesis | What did the team think the boundary state, alignment, readiness, context cut, or export validity was before the probe? |
| Observed or inferred post-probe state | What changed, stabilized, became visible, became non-exportable, or lost lawful use because of the probe or interaction? |
| Update class, if load-bearing | Is the update a system/work change, epistemic reading update, carrier/output update, or formal model/update-law change? |
| State-change evidence | Which traces, changed decisions, changed labels, changed priorities, behavior shifts, timing changes, or export failures support the state-change reading? |
| Uncertainty / confidence posture | What remains inferred, approximate, disputed, probe-dependent, or not yet distinguishable? |
| State history / memory, if load-bearing | State this only when path dependence, order effect, hysteresis, or retained trace changes the current lawful reading. |
| Decision | What changes now: mark probe-coupled, redesign probe/order/frame, add evidence, rewrite bridge/export, split/merge/orchestrate differently, or reroute? |
| Decoupling / redesign option | Can the probe, order, frame, bridge, metric, dashboard, API read, or boundary interaction be redesigned so the needed output is less state-changing or more faithfully exportable? |

#### C.26.1:4.1 - Activation boundary

This pattern is active only when the interaction both participates in the represented state and its output is being used as evidence, export, comparison input, or decision input as if it were passive. A passive-read, unjustified lossless-transfer, one-way-message, or ordinary-bridge treatment must be materially false for the current decision.

Ordinary influence is not enough. A meeting that changes attention is ordinary work unless the meeting output is later used as a passive reading of alignment. An API call that is a mutating operation by its interface semantics is ordinary service/API semantics unless the call result is used as a neutral state export. A feature flag that changes behavior is ordinary intervention unless the flag readout is being used as evidence of the state it changes.

Performative prediction is also a strong ordinary rival. If a prediction, score, or metric changes behavior because people act on it, but no incompatible probe frame, order-sensitive reading, contextual-probability cue, or instrument-like state/export burden remains, try performative-prediction analysis and the ordinary `C.16` / `A.10` / `B.3` routes first. Keep C.26.1 only for the residual probe-lawfulness burden.


#### C.26.1:4.2 - Finish conditions

The pattern emits one of these results:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Keep boundary, mark probe-coupled | The boundary remains, but the read/export is no longer treated as passive. |
| Redesign probe/order/frame | The workshop, dashboard, API read, survey, metric, or question order changes to reduce distortion. |
| Redesign bridge/export | The bridge/export gains loss notes, use scope, confidence, and return-to-source path. |
| Split/merge/orchestrate differently | Boundary structure changes because the interaction changes the phenomenon. |
| Route to `F.9` | Only bridge/loss remains live. |
| Route to `C.16` | The probe is really a standard measurement with declared scale, method, evidence, and result. |
| Route to `A.15` | The hard part is work enactment rather than probe-coupled reading. |
| Route to `C.25` | Viability-envelope regulation is primary. |

#### C.26.1:4.3 - Probe-coupled context-cut worked use slice

This worked use slice is not a standalone pattern. It tests DDD and bounded-context work when the context cut is not only discovered but also changes meaning, coordination, export validity, or viability.

Ask: was the bounded-context cut merely discovered, or did the workshop, dashboard, API extraction, bridge, split, merge, or orchestration change alignment, ownership, vocabulary, export validity, or viability?

| Slice field | Example content |
| --- | --- |
| Case | A product organization considers splitting payment handling out of a checkout bounded context after repeated payment-failure incidents. |
| Ordinary DDD finding | Checkout and Payment use different local meanings for `Order.status`, `PaymentFailure`, and `Retryable`; an ordinary `F.9` bridge is needed. |
| Probe / intervention | The event-storming workshop starts from payment-failure dashboards and asks teams to place incidents by owner, customer impact, and recovery path. |
| Post-probe reading | Product, Support, and Payment start treating payment failure as a customer-risk gate, not only a technical retry condition. |
| Evidence | Incident labels are reclassified, escalation changes, backlog priority changes, and the dashboard query is rewritten. |
| Export loss | Copying `PaymentFailure = customer risk` into both contexts loses the difference between retryable technical failure, promise breach, and support escalation trigger. |
| Decision output | Keep the split, mark the workshop result as probe-coupled, add `F.9` loss notes, and add a payment-risk escalation promise to the boundary design. |

#### C.26.1:4.4 - Governed object and operational sequence

The governed object is a boundary interaction used as evidence, export, comparison input, or architecture decision input. The interaction may be a meeting, question sequence, dashboard, metric, API read, survey, workshop, event stream, canary, test harness, service split, bridge, message, or management review. The pattern is active only when that interaction participates in the represented state strongly enough that passive-read or unjustified lossless-transfer wording would change the decision.

The pattern governs one move: convert an apparently passive boundary read into a typed probe-coupled boundary decision. That decision says what the interaction read, what it changed, what the output can support, what it cannot support, and which neighboring FPF pattern takes over if the burden is really bridge, measurement, evidence, work, decision, or viability.

Action path:

1. Name the boundary or relation being crossed.
2. Name the probe lane, including the concrete artifact or work act that produced the output.
3. State the false passive reading: what the team would have assumed if the probe were only a window.
4. State the pre-probe hypothesis and the observed or inferred post-probe state.
5. State the evidence carriers and uncertainty posture.
6. State the export loss, memory, order effect, or frame effect that makes the output not faithful enough for the declared use.
7. Choose the finish result: keep boundary with probe note, redesign probe/order/frame, redesign bridge/export, change split/merge/orchestration, or reroute.

Output contract: produce a probe-coupled interaction reading, a corrected use of the output, and, when it would reduce the problem, a redesign or decoupling move for the probe, order, frame, bridge, metric, dashboard, API read, or boundary interaction.

This sequence is deliberately small. It is the boundary analogue of the `C.11` local choice pass: the pattern should end with a usable result, not with a richer vocabulary label.

#### C.26.1:4.5 - Well-formed probe-coupled boundary state

A probe-coupled boundary decision is usable only when the record states all of the following:

- the boundary, context bridge, service interface, team boundary, role relation, authority relation, or system edge involved;
- the probe lane and output carrier;
- the state reading before the interaction and the state reading after the interaction;
- the state-change evidence, including traces, changed labels, changed priorities, changed timings, changed routines, changed bridge fields, or changed downstream decisions;
- the local stop condition: which stronger use the output does not support without another pattern;
- the neighboring route that would carry a stronger claim.

The record is unfinished when any of these remains true:

- the output is named, but the operation that produced it is hidden;
- the operation is named, but the state that changed is not named;
- the state changed, but the decision that changes because of that fact is not named;
- the bridge/export loss is stated only as a vague warning rather than as a concrete unsupported use;
- the same interaction is alternately treated as evidence, command, measurement, and bridge without role split.

The weak supported output is often enough: "this dashboard value is probe-coupled evidence for readiness behavior under window W"; "this workshop work changed alignment and therefore the workshop note cannot be treated as passive discovery"; "this API read is a non-neutral observation under these interface semantics"; "this context cut needs both `F.9` bridge loss and C.26.1 probe-coupling treatment."

#### C.26.1:4.6 - Probe, observable, output, and carrier split

Do not identify the thing being asked with the method that asks it, the output that appears, or the artifact that carries the output.

| Role | Boundary-facing question |
| --- | --- |
| Observable / output dimension | What readiness, status, alignment, failure, response, risk, split, promise, or boundary condition is being read? |
| Probe method | Which dashboard, API read, workshop order, survey, canary, incident review, event stream, or meeting format acts on the situation? |
| Measurement / interaction scheme | What timing, threshold, sampling rule, question order, aggregation, publication path, or access path shapes the output? |
| Output / result | What score, label, context map, API response, survey answer, incident class, readiness status, or bridge field was emitted? |
| State update | What behavior, alignment, meaning, trust, priority, escalation, or timing changed because of the probe? |
| Evidence carrier | Which log, dashboard export, meeting note, trace, decision record, ticket history, context map, or API result carries the output? |

This split prevents a common mistake: "the dashboard says ready" hides at least four objects. The dashboard definition, the displayed result, the behavior it changes, and the readiness decision are not the same thing.

#### C.26.1:4.7 - Reroute and disambiguation guide

Use this guide when a draft says that a boundary, system, team, or service is "coupled", "aligned", "interacting", "measured", "exported", "synchronized", or "read".

| Trigger surface | First question | If yes | If no |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "The dashboard shows readiness." | Did publishing or using the dashboard change readiness behavior, escalation, staffing, or release posture? | Use C.26.1; state probe, update, evidence, and supported use. | Use `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, or ordinary reporting. |
| "The workshop discovered the boundary." | Did question order, framing, participants, or artifacts change local meaning, ownership, trust, or viability? | Use C.26.1 with this context-cut worked use slice; add `F.9` if bridge/export loss is live. | Use ordinary DDD / `F.9` bounded-context work. |
| "The API read returns state." | Is the read path state-changing under interface semantics, timing, cache, consistency, or downstream behavior? | Use C.26.1 if the result is later treated as a passive read. | Use ordinary API semantics, measurement, or data freshness. |
| "The message transferred the decision." | Did the message change authority, trust, escalation, timing, or local meaning enough that copy/transfer is false? | Use C.26.1 and route commitments or authority to the relevant work/authority pattern. | Use publication, bridge, or work enactment patterns. |
| "The split improved viability." | Did the split/probe alter the viability envelope being evaluated? | Coordinate with `C.26.3`. | Use ordinary boundary, quality-bundle, or architecture patterns. |

When relation wording is load-bearing, do not mint a relation token here. Keep the sentence as local explanatory prose or route reusable relation work to `A.6.P` / `F.18`.

#### C.26.1:4.8 - Positive examples and near misses

| Case | Supported C.26.1 use | Near miss / reroute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Readiness dashboard | The readiness score changes team behavior: teams stop surfacing borderline failures because the dashboard is watched by release management. The score is probe-coupled evidence, not a passive readiness copy. | If the dashboard only reports a well-defined measure with no behavior-changing or frame-changing burden, use `C.16` plus evidence patterns. |
| API consistency check | A "read" through a cache warms entries and changes later latency, so the readout changes the performance state later used in the decision. | If the call is simply a mutating operation by interface semantics, use ordinary API/work semantics and say so plainly. |
| Survey order | Asking "who owns incidents?" before "which context owns payment failure?" changes the resulting context map and escalation plan. | If different answers merely reveal unresolved meanings, use `F.9` / `A.6.P` first. |
| Event-storming workshop | The workshop produces a map and also changes team alignment, local vocabulary, and backlog priority. | If it only documents known differences, use ordinary DDD and bridge fields. |
| Service split | Splitting Checkout and Payment changes recovery paths and support load, so the split is part of the phenomenon being evaluated. | If the split only reduces deployment coupling with no probe/export effect, use ordinary boundary and quality patterns. |
| Incident metric | Publishing "cache failover is the primary risk" shifts attention, staffing, and reproduction work. | If the metric is only a report of already-carried evidence, use `A.10` / `B.3`. |

The positive examples are intentionally ordinary. QL value here is not exotic formalism; it is noticing that a read, metric, workshop, or interface often participates in the state it later claims to report.

#### C.26.1:4.9 - Evidence posture for probe-coupled claims

Use the weakest evidence posture that still supports the intended use.

| Evidence posture | Supported use | Typical carriers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `QLP-0` recognition | Flag a likely probe-coupled situation for local discussion. | Meeting note, dashboard screenshot, issue comment, context-map draft. |
| `QLP-1` local working use | Change a local probe/order/frame, bridge note, or boundary decision in a team setting. | Before/after labels, changed tickets, changed dashboard query, changed escalation path, changed architecture note. |
| `QLP-2` decision-bearing / reusable use | Publish as a repeatable FPF example or organization guideline, or use the reading in a local decision with consequence. | Multiple cases, comparison with ordinary routes, named uncertainty, near-miss cases. |
| `QLP-3` assurance / reusable-law use | Use in release, audit, contractual, reusable-law, or high-impact decision support. | Evidence graph, measurement method, assurance tuple, traceable source records, rival explanation comparison. |

Do not make `QLP-3` the ordinary entry cost. Most practical C.26.1 use lives at `QLP-0` or `QLP-1`, with escalation only when the output is reused or carries higher consequence.

### C.26.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding


Tell: A team runs a service-boundary workshop after a series of incidents. The first map says "Payments is separate from Checkout". A week later, incident triage and backlog priorities have changed because the workshop reframed payment failure as a customer-promise risk.

Show, System side: the teams, services, dashboards, event stream, workshop format, and escalation routine are part of the boundary situation. The workshop is not only a carrier of information; it changes alignment and future work.

Show, Episteme side: the weak claim is not "the workshop discovered the true topology." It is "the workshop work functioned as a probe lane that changed the represented boundary state and exposed export loss across Checkout and Payment." The next lawful move is a boundary/probe decision plus `F.9` bridge notes.

### C.26.1:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern biases authors against passive-reading convenience. That bias is useful when dashboards, workshops, surveys, and API reads are treated as if they carry state without changing it.

The pattern also biases authors against overusing QL. It explicitly reroutes ordinary intervention, ordinary message passing, ordinary bridge loss, ordinary API semantics, and ordinary work enactment to their existing FPF patterns when no probe-coupled reading remains.

### C.26.1:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Check |
| --- | --- |
| CC-C26.1.1 | The boundary, role relation, authority relation, bridge, split, or queried system edge is named. |
| CC-C26.1.2 | The active probe or interaction lane is typed as work, method, measurement, speech act, interaction channel, evidence carrier, bridge/export act, or API/service operation; any quantum-instrument wording is recorded only as a modeling analogy unless formalized elsewhere. |
| CC-C26.1.3 | Observable, probe method, measurement/interaction scheme, output/result, update class, and evidence carrier are separated when they carry the claim. |
| CC-C26.1.4 | The QL cue / formal cue is named or the case reroutes away from QL wording. |
| CC-C26.1.5 | The false passive reading or unjustified lossless-transfer reading is stated. |
| CC-C26.1.6 | The pre-probe hypothesis and observed/inferred post-probe state are stated without fake precision. |
| CC-C26.1.7 | State-change evidence and uncertainty/confidence posture are stated. |
| CC-C26.1.8 | State history, memory, path dependence, or order/frame sensitivity is stated when load-bearing. |
| CC-C26.1.9 | The state change, export loss, or viability change caused by the probe/interaction is stated. |
| CC-C26.1.10 | The output is one of the pattern finish conditions. |
| CC-C26.1.11 | The decoupling, probe-redesign, order-redesign, frame-redesign, bridge-redesign, or boundary-redesign option is stated when it could reduce the problem. |
| CC-C26.1.12 | The local evidence posture is stated when the claim is reused, contested, or higher consequence. |
| CC-C26.1.13 | Ordinary intervention, bridge, work, measurement, and viability routes are tried before QL wording is retained. |
| CC-C26.1.14 | Coupling or interaction wording is not minted as a reusable relation token without `A.6.P` / `F.18`. |
| CC-C26.1.15 | The pattern inherits `QL-NQ` from `C.26` instead of restating the inherited boundary as local law. |

### C.26.1:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them


| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Every interaction is QL | Any message, meeting, or API call is called probe-coupled. | Require a false passive-read, export, comparison, or optimization use. |
| Causal action mistaken for probe | A deployment or command changes the world, and QL is invoked. | Use intervention/work owners unless the action is being used as a readout of the state it changes. |
| Bridge loss alone | Export loses local meaning, but no state-changing probe is live. | Use `F.9` with loss notes. |
| Context-word drift | `context` means probe frame in one sentence and `U.BoundedContext` in the next. | Use `U.BoundedContext` only for semantic context; otherwise say probe frame, model frame, or measurement setup. |
| Relation token leakage | `coupledBy(...)` appears as if already ratified. | Keep it as local drafting form or route to `A.6.P` / `F.18`. |

### C.26.1:9 - Consequences

This pattern makes boundary decisions more honest. It turns "the workshop showed the split" into "the workshop both showed and changed the split-relevant state." It turns "the dashboard says ready" into "the dashboard is probe-coupled evidence with a limited decision use."

The cost is that some familiar artifacts lose false authority. Dashboards, workshops, surveys, API reads, and messages remain useful, but they no longer get to pretend they are always neutral windows.

### C.26.1:10 - Rationale

The pattern exists because boundary work is where the QL lens becomes practically visible fastest. Teams already experience dashboard effects, workshop effects, order effects, and bridge loss. The pattern gives those experiences a lightweight, typed, ordinary-pattern-compatible form.

The pattern is not a generic interaction theory. It is a boundary/probe repair for cases where passive read or unjustified lossless-transfer reading is materially false.

### C.26.1:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Pattern claim | Practice / source | Pattern implication | Adoption stance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A probe or instrument can produce both an output and a state update; the output alone does not specify the operation. | [Quantum-instrument modeling of question order, response replicability, and QQ-equality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249620301152). | Ask what operation produced both output and update before treating dashboards, API reads, workshops, surveys, or metrics as passive reads. | Adapt the instrument/update lesson; do not import a full organization ontology. |
| Contextual judgment and order effects are common enough to be a practical modeling cue. | [Quantum Cognition](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-033020-123501). | Treat question order, workshop order, and dashboard framing as possible state-shaping operations when they change the decision. | Adopt as a recognition cue with critical limits. |
| Classical instrument models may explain some sequential-decision data, so QL is useful but not uniquely necessary by default. | [Quantum-like Cognition in Process Theories: An Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.08604). | Keep rival routes visible; QL remains a modeling lens, not a necessity claim. | Use as non-exclusivity discipline. |
| A prediction, score, or metric can change the target distribution because people act on it, without requiring a QL probe reading. | [Performative Prediction](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/perdomo20a.html). | Route dashboard-induced or score-induced behavior to performative-prediction and ordinary measurement/intervention/work patterns unless a residual incompatible-probe, order, contextual-probability, or instrument-like export burden remains. | Adopt as a classical rival route that sharpens when C.26.1 is actually useful. |

| Boundaries can be modeled by what a system can measure, model, and affect, while mathematical boundary descriptions are not new worldly substances. | [The Computational Boundary of a Self](https://philpapers.org/rec/LEVTCB-3) and [The Markov blankets of life](https://philarchive.org/rec/KIRTMB). | Make the boundary/probe relation explicit without reifying the boundary or coupling phrase. | Adapt for boundary-function discipline. |
| Bounded-context and microservice practice already governs ordinary domain cuts and integration points. | [Use domain analysis to model microservices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/domain-analysis) and [DDD in software development: a 2025 SLR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121225002055). | Use C.26.1 only when the cut, workshop, bridge, dashboard, API extraction, split, or merge changes represented boundary state or export validity. | Use DDD as baseline; add C.26.1 only for the probe-coupled burden. |

Worked-use-slice discipline from these rows:

- start from the ordinary FPF pattern before QL wording;
- show the concrete operation that produced the output;
- show the state update or export loss that changes the decision;
- keep relation tokens local unless `A.6.P` / `F.18` gives them a reusable declaration;
- keep source-formalism language as modeling support, not as pattern-body ontology.

### C.26.1:12 - Relations


- Builds on: `C.26`, `A.6`, `A.6.B`, `A.6.P`, `F.9`, `A.15`, `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `C.25`, `A.1.1`.
- Coordinates with: `C.26.2` when coordinated work evidences a non-exportable distributed state; `C.26.3` when the boundary interaction changes a viability envelope.
- Carries: a worked use slice inside `C.26.1:4.3`, not a standalone pattern or relation token.
- Does not mint: `U.Probe`, a new boundary kind, or reusable relation predicates.
- Name posture: `Probe-Coupled Boundary Interaction` names a boundary/probe burden, not `Entangled Boundary`, `CoupledBy(...)`, `Interaction Field`, `State-Changing Communication`, or a reusable relation token. Relation wording remains local until `A.6.P` / `F.18` ratifies it.

### C.26.1:End
